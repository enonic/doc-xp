Enonic XP is available as a Service. However, since XP also exists as software, it can be deployed and hosted in your favorite infrastructure.

This section is dedicated to configuration, tuning, and day2 operations for anyone looking to host the platform themselves.

NOTE: These pages are also relevant when working with sandboxes in local development environments.
