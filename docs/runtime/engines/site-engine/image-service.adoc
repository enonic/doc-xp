= Image service
:toc: right
:toclevels: 2
:imagesdir: media

The image service enables real-time processing and delivery of rasterized RGB/RGBa image media via the `:8080/site/<repo>/<branch>/<path-to-page>/_/image/` endpoint

The image services are usually only used from one of our APIs: +
<<../../../api/lib-portal#imageurl, Portal API, imageUrl>> +
https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable/usage#accessing_images[Guillotine api, imageUrl]

== Image URL

An image URL consists of the following components:

. Endpoint, followed by a forward slash. +
  Format: `:8080/site/<repo>/<branch>/<path-to-page>/_/image/` +
  On a live site behind virtualhost, everything before the path is typically hidden.
. Content key, followed by a colon. +
  Example: `c82262a6-77d6-4276-b0e7-fe82f4eb57b8:`
. Content version key, followed by a forward slash. +
  Example: `1feb57ed672f8c3b9fd6d4614878dafd9882298b/`
. Scaling (method followed by arguments, separated by dashes), followed by a forward slash. +
  Example: `block-300-100/`
. File name equal to content name. +
  Example: `content-name.png`
. (Optional) Format extension, preceded by a period. +
  Example: `.jpg`
. URL parameters, such as background or filter (URI encoded, filter values are semicolon-separated) +
  Example: `?background=0x777777&filter=sharpen%28%29%3Brounded%2820%2C3%29`

NOTE: If format extension is specified, content gets converted to a corresponding format. Otherwise, the MIME type is derived directly from the content.

NOTE: Supported format extensions are `.jpg`, `.png` and `.gif`. Other extensions may still work but are not supported.

WARNING: Content with MIME type `image/gif` and `image/svg+xml` returned as-is without any processing.

Example of an image URL on the root of a live site behind virtualhost:

== Scaling methods

=== Block
[[block]]

image::scaling-block.jpg[Scaled to block, 300px]

Scales the image to fill the given dimensions, then crops off any overflowing content based on the focal point position.
This is the most common scaling method for web purposes, since the image will always have the exact dimensions as the given input.

Arguments::
  Both arguments below are required:
  width:::
    Width in pixels
  height:::
    Height in pixels

Example::
----
block-300-100
----

=== Height

image::scaling-height.jpg[Scaled to height, 228px]

Scales the image proportionally to match the given height. No cropping. Width may vary depending on aspect ratio.

Arguments::

  height:::
    Height in pixels

Example::
----
height-300
----

=== Max

image::scaling-height.jpg[Scaled to max, 228px]

Scales the image proportionally until the longest edge has the given number of pixels.
Typically used if the image will be displayed inside a square container but must not be cropped (e.g. diagrams or logo images that must fit inside a square table cell)

Arguments::

  size:::
    The length of the longest edge in pixels. Required.

Example::
----
max-300
----

=== Square

image::scaling-square.jpg[Scaled to square, 300px]

Scales the image proprtionally to match the shortest edge, resulting in a square image. Any overflowing content will be cropped based on the focal point position.

Arguments::

  size:::
    The length of both sides in pixels

Example::
----
square-300
----

=== Wide

image::scaling-block.jpg[Scaled to wide, 300px]

Similar to scale <<block>>, but will never crop off the left/right sides of the image.
The resulting image would always be as wide as the given width, but if the image has a wider aspect ratio than given, it would end up being lower than the given height.

Arguments::

  width:::
    Width in pixels
  height:::
    Maximum height in pixels

Example::
----
wide-300-100
----

=== Width

image::scaling-width.jpg[Scaled to width, 300px]

Scales the image proportionally to match the given width. No cropping. Height may vary depending on aspect ratio.

Arguments::

  width:::
    Width in pixels

Example::
----
width-300
----

=== Full

No scaling

Example::
----
full
----

== Filters

NOTE: Some (but not all) of the filters below perform under-the-hood calculations measured in pixels,
which means that images of various dimensions will have the effect applied differently.
This is especially apparent if the images are forced to fit a specific container size on the client.
In order to ensure a consistent result, consider upscaling your image to a specific size before applying the filter, or downscale if the effect should be larger in relation to the image.

//- Sorted in pseudo-alphabetical order. Grouping by main function, e.g. "RGB Adjust" and "HSB Adjust" are both instances of Adjust

=== RGB Adjust

image::styling-rgbadjust2_0_n2.jpg[RGB Adjust towards orange, 152px]

Adjust the red, green and blue levels in the image.

Values between -1.0 and 0.0 subtract that color channel in the image.
A value of 0 results in no adjustment for that channel.
Values between 0 and 255 boosts that color channel in the image. The boost is logarithmic, so small boost values between 0 and 1 are often enough.

Arguments::

//- The arguments below are technically not "required" since they default to 0, but rgbadjust() with anything less than 3 arguments makes no sense.
  red:::
    Decimal value with the adjusted red level for the image. Required.
  green:::
    Decimal value with the adjusted green level for the image. Required.
  blue:::
    Decimal value with the adjusted blue level for the image. Required.

Example::
----
rgbadjust(0.0,-1.0,-1.0) <1>
rgbadjust(0.0,0.0,-1.0) <2>
rgbadjust(1.0,0.0,-1.0) <3>
----
<1> Red channel only, otherwise black
<2> No blue channel, otherwise unmodified
<3> No blue channel, boosted red channel (as seen in the image above)

=== HSB Adjust

image::styling-hsbadjust.jpg[HSB Adjust to oppsite colors, 152px]

Adjust the hue, saturation and brightness levels in the image.

NOTE: This effect is a lot more rudimentary than the Hue/Saturation effect in Photoshop.
For instance, when reducing saturation, all colors below a certain threshold are strictly converted to grayscale instead of being desaturated.
The use of values outside of +/-0.2 is not recommended.

Arguments::

  hue:::
    Decimal value from -1 to 1, of how far around the color wheel to move the hue of the image. Required. (0 is no change)
  saturation:::
    Decimal value from -1 to 1 to adjust the intensity of the colors in the image. Default: 0
  brightness:::
    Decimal value from -1 to 1 to adjust the brightness of the image. Default: 0

Examples::
----
hsbadjust(-0.15,0.2,-0.2)
----

=== Block

image::styling-block5.jpg[Blocks 5 pixels large, 152px]

Reduces the image down to a mosaic of larger square pixels. Also known as pixelate.

Arguments::

  size:::
    The size of each square mosaic block, in pixels. Default: 2

Example::
----
block(5)
----

=== Blur
[[blur]]

image::styling-blur8.jpg[8 pixel blur, 152px]

Applies a Gaussian blur-like effect, based on the given pixel radius. The opposite of <<sharpen>>, although it's not possible to reverse a sharpen with a blur.

Arguments::

  radius:::
    How many pixels of blur to apply. Higher values lead to a more blurry image, values below 2 result in no blur. Default: 2

Example::
----
blur(8)
----

=== Border

image::styling-border4_0x777777.jpg[Solid gray 4 pixel border, 152px]

Applies a rectangular border with a solid color around the image.

Arguments::

  width:::
    The width of the border in pixels. Default: 2
  color:::
    The color of the border as a decimal or hexadecimal number. Default: 0x000000 (black)

Examples::
----
border(5)
border(4, 0x777777)
----

=== Bump
[[bump]]

image::styling-bump.jpg[Bump effect, 152px]

Creates a pseudo-3D bevel effect based on edge contours in the image.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
bump()
----

=== Colorize

image::styling-colorize.jpg[Colorize to magenta, 152px]

Makes a grayscale image, then applies a tint based on the color given with red, green and blue values.

Arguments::

  red:::
    Red boost value. Default: 1
  green:::
    Green boost value. Default: 1
  blue:::
    Blue boost value. Default: 1

Example::
----
colorize(3,1,1.5)
----

=== HSB Colorize

image::styling-hsbcolorize.jpg[Colorize to cyan, 152px]

Makes a grayscale image, then applies a tint based on the color given with hue, saturation, and brightness.

Arguments::

  color:::
    The tint color as a decimal or hexadecimal number. Default: 0xFFFFFF

Example::
----
hsbcolorize(0x00AAAA)
----

=== Edge

image::styling-edge.jpg[Edge effect, 152px]

Creates an abstract image by brightening every edge contour and darkening every even surface of the image.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
edge()
----

=== Emboss

image::styling-emboss.jpg[Emboss effect, 152px]

Creates a grayscale image with a pseudo-3D bevel effect based on edge contours in the image. Areas with no contours are normalized to a neutral gray.
If colors need to be kept as they were, consider using <<bump>> instead.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
emboss()
----

=== Flip horizontally

image::styling-fliph.jpg[Flipped horizontally, 152px]

Flips an image horizontally (mirrored left-right).

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
flipv()
----

=== Grayscale

image::styling-grayscale.jpg[Grayscale effect, 152px]

Creates a grayscale variant of the image.

TIP: Use an adjustment filter in front of the grayscale filter in order to affect how bright or dark different portions of the image will be, e.g. to highlight skin tones.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
grayscale()
----

=== Invert

image::styling-invert.jpg[Inverted colors, 152px]

Inverts the colors and brightness of the image.

NOTE: The human eye does not have a linear response across the whole visible spectrum,
so inverting the image may have unexpected effects on text contrast in relation to the processed image.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
invert()
----

=== Rotate 90

image::styling-rotate90.jpg[Rotated 90 degrees, 200px]

Rotates an image clockwise 90 degrees. Width and height dimensions get swapped, e.g. a 200x100 pixel image becomes 100x200 pixels.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
rotate90()
----

=== Rotate 180

image::styling-rotate180.jpg[Rotated 180 degrees, 152px]

Rotates an image 180 degrees.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
rotate270()
----

=== Rounded

image::styling-rounded8_4_0x777777.jpg[Rounded corners with added border, 152px]

Rounds the corners of the image, with an option of adding a border around the rounded image which also has rounded corners.

TIP: To create a circular image, apply a scale square at a desired number of pixels for the diameter, and then apply rounded with radius set to half that amount of pixels for the radius.

NOTE: If the image format has been set to PNG, the negative space outside the rounded corners is rendered as transparent.
If the image format has been set to JPG, the negative space outside the rounded corners is rendered as the background color.

Arguments::

  radius:::
    The number of pixels from each corner where the rounding starts. Default: 10
  borderSize:::
    The width of the border in pixels. Default: 0
  borderColor:::
    The color of the border as a decimal or hexadecimal number. Default: 0 / 0x000000 (black)

Examples::
----
rounded()
rounded(15)
rounded(10,1)
rounded(8,4,0x777777)
----

=== Sepia

image::styling-sepia25.jpg[Sepia effect, 152px]

Arguments::

  depth:::
    The brightness of the tint. Default: 20

Examples::
----

sepia(25)
----

=== Sharpen
[[sharpen]]

image::styling-sharpen.jpg[Sharpen effect, 152px]

Applies a sharpening filter to the image, making edge contours more pronounced. The opposite of <<blur>>, although it's not possible to reverse a blur with a sharpen.

NOTE: If the source image has a lot of compression artifacts or has very low resolution, sharpening the image will make these artifacts stand out even more, which usually is undesired.

Arguments::
  No arguments

Example::
----
sharpen()
----
