= Asset service
:toc: right

Applications commonly need to serve static files such as icons, css and javascript to their clients.
XP provides a standard and cache optimized approach to serving assets.

== Endpoint

The attachment endpoint is located at the root of an application or site's url space as `/_/asset/`.

The asset endpoint consists of three elements:

* Mount point `/_/asset/`
* App identifier with optional _hash_ i.e. `com.company.app` or `com.company.app:235293024/`
* Asset path i.e. `path/to/asset.css`

A complete asset URL pattern: `<app-root>/\_/asset/<app-name><:build-id>/<asset-path>` i.e. `company.com/_/asset/com.company.app:235293024/path/to/asset.css`


== Asset files

To make an asset available, simply place it in your projects `src/main/resources/assets/` folder.
Once the application is deployed, it will be publicly available through the asset endpoint.

====
If a file is placed in your projects `src/main/resources/assets/path/to/asset.ext`
- the same file will always be available on the contextual url: ``<webapp-root>/_/asset/<app-name>/path/to/myasset.ext``.
====

== Cache headers

To optimize the user experience and offload the XP back-end, the asset service supports so-called "perfect caching".
By adding a unique hash to the asset url, the asset service will automatically set "infinite cache headers" (`cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`) when serving the asset.

If application assets are changed, a new asset URL can be generated.
This effectively prevents stale cache issues, and optimizes performance at the same time.

== assetUrl()

To safely generate a perfect cache asset URL, use the assetUrl function that is part of the <<../../api/lib-portal#,Portal Library>>
