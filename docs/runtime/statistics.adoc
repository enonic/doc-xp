== Monitoring

We provide some basic metric tools for monitoring which are easily accessed in a simple JSON format. To access the monitoring JSON feed you can point to the following url:

 GET http://<host>:2609/

TIP: `<host>` equals `localhost` on the machine with running enonic XP instance

This will give you a list of status-reporters. Each reporter has a name and can be accessed using the following pattern:

 GET http://<host>:2609/<name>

Here’s a list of all the status pages and what is shows:

cache.com.enonic.xp.webSessionCache::
Statistics about the web session cache.
cluster.elasticsearch::
Information about the ElasticSearch cluster. Local-node and members.
cluster.manager::
Information about the state of the clusters: elasticsearch
dump.deadlocks::
This will try to detect thread deadlocks and show them if any.
dump.threads::
Dumps all current thread-states.
http.filter::
List of servlet filters registered. It shows class, order and the URL patterns to which it applies.
http.servlet::

== Cluster monitoring

There are multiple tools at your disposal for monitoring the health of the clusters and indices:

=== Cluster health

 GET http://<host>:2609/cluster.manager

To obtain a generic health check of the clusters. It should return you a response similar to:
[source, json]
----
{
    "state": "OK",
    "clusters": [
        {
            "id": "elasticsearch",
            "enabled": true,
            "healthy": true,
            "numberOfNodesSeen": 3
        }
    ]
}
----

This view gives a brief overview of the nodes in the cluster.

=== ElasticSearch cluster health

 GET http://<host>:2609/cluster.elasticsearch

Which should return you a response similar to:
[source, json]

This view gives a brief overview of the nodes in the cluster. For convenience, the current local node to which the request was made has a separate entry in addition to being in the list of members.

The `state` property is the most important:

- *Green*: Cluster is operational and all configured replicas are distributed to a node
- *Yellow*: Cluster is operational, but there are replicas that are not distributed to any node
- *Red*: Cluster is not operational

To see the details about how the replicas are distributed, let’s continue to the `Index stats` report:

=== Index stats

 GET http://<host>:2609/index

Which should give you a response like this:

This gives an overview of how the indices are distributed and what state the index parts (*shards*) are currently in. A shard could be either `PRIMARY` or `REPLICA` (copy of a primary shard). These are the possible states:

- *total*: Total number of index parts (e.g two repositories with two indices with one replica for each index)
- *started*: Shards that are currently assigned to a node
- *unassigned*: Shards waiting to be distributed to a node. Typically a setup with a number of replicas where one or more nodes are not running
- *relocating*: Shards that are currently moving from one node to another
- *initializing*: Shards that are currently being recovered from disk at startup.

The `shards` section gives a more detailed overview on the shard distribution.
