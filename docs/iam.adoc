Enonic XP ships with a clearly defined and pluggable concept for handling authentication and authorization

== Introduction

Enonic XP ships with a standard concept handling users, authentication, groups and roles based authorization.
Additionally, the NoSQL storage supports fine-grained access control mechanisms down to a single item.


== IAM Concepts
XP IAM consists of three central concepts:

=== Principals
Principals are object that can be given permissions.
There are three different types of principals:

Users:: Principals that can be authenticated.
Groups::  Used to group other principals to simplify management.
Roles:: Provides access to application specific functionality.


== Permissions
Principals may be given with fine grade access to items stored in the NoSQL storage.
An example of this is the XP CMS, where users typically get access to create or publish content in specific areas of the solution.

== Identity providers

ID providers offer pluggable abstraction layer for user authentication.
As such, in order to authenticate or even create users in XP, you will need to define an ID provider.

ID providers are linked to your webapp or site through <<./deployment/vhosts#,virtual hosts>>.


=== Creating an ID provider
ID providers can be created and managed through the API,
or through the Users app in the XP admin console.

An ID provider essentially consist of the following:

* A unique name (cannot be changed later)
* ID provider application, with optional configuration settings.
* Permissions - specifies who can manage and access the ID provider

NOTE: ID provider applications must be installed before you can select them.

[#system-id-provider]
=== System ID provider

XP ships with a special ID provider that cannot be removed or renamed. It is called the System ID provider.

When accessing the XP admin console for the first time in a fresh installation, you will see the login screen of System ID provider.

The purpose of the System ID provider is to hold system users such as `su` - the Super User, and `anonymous` - the user that is _de facto_ if no other user is specified.

System ID provider users - other than system users - are called <<#service-accounts>>.

NOTE: Prior to XP 7.14.0, manually added users to the System ID provider were treated as regular users with username-password credentials. System ID provider username-password credentials are still supported, but strongly discouraged. Instead, use service accounts with JWT tokens. See <<#service-accounts>> for more details.

NOTE: Avoid placing your regular users in the System ID provider, rather create a new ID provider instead.

[#service-accounts]
==== Service Accounts

A service account is a special kind of user used by remote applications and services to authenticate with XP.
Service accounts are not meant to be used by humans.

Service accounts are used to make authorized call to

* <<management_endpoint, Management Endpoint>>
* any other XP service port endpoint that supports authentication and configured to use the System ID provider. See <<deployment/vhosts#virtual-hosts, Virtual Hosts>> for more details.

Requests are authenticated by JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

The content of the header should look like the following:
[source,options="nowrap"]
Authorization: Bearer <token>

JWT token must follow the following rules:

* it must be valid RFC-7519 JWT token.
* `alg` header parameter must be set to `RS256`.
* `kid` header parameter must be set to the ID of the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign the token.
* `sub` claim must be set to the ID of the service account, for instance, `user:system:user_id`.
* `exp` claim must be set to the expiration time of the token. The token will be rejected if it is expired.
* `iat` claim must be set to the time when the token was issued. The token will be rejected if it was issued in the future.

Private key from Public-Private key-pair is stored only on the client side and must not be shared with the XP server.

Public key from Public-Private key-pair is stored in the XP server and is used to verify the signature of the token.
Each service account can store multiple Public keys in order to support rotation of Public-Private key-pairs without service interruption.

NOTE: Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. Make sure to rotate keys regularly and keep them safe. If you suspect that your keys have been compromised, you can revoke them in the Users app. Whenever possible use other ID providers instead, such as OIDC ID provider.

=== ID provider apps

In order for an ID provider to work, it must be associated with an ID provider application that handles the authentication process.

You may install ID providers from Enonic Market,
or <<./framework/idprovider#, build your own>> for a fully customized experience.

=== Standard ID provider app

By default, XP ships with an app called the "Standard ID provider".
This is also the app that is being used by the <<#system-id-provider>>

== Built-in roles

Enonic XP is shipped with several built-in roles (described below) which grant certain permissions when applied to users.
New roles can be created by users with *Administrators* and *Users Administrator* roles.

NOTE: Permissions for every role can be overridden by *Administrator* or *Content Manager Administrator* on the content level.

*Administrator*
Users with the *Administrator* role have full access to all content and admin tools through the user interface.

**Administration Console Login**
Users with this role can log in to the administration console. These users will also require a role for each of the admin tools that the users need access to.

*Content Manager Administrator*

This role allows full access to Content Studio, including ability to create and delete content projects.

*Content Manager Expert*

This role gives members ability to view and modify source code in the rich text editor.

*Content Manager App*

Give users to access to the legacy `default` project in Content Studio. Users with this role can see content and sites, but cannot create new sites or any new content in the project.

NOTE: As of v7.3, XP supports creation of custom content projects. These offer project-specific roles that automatically provide access to both Content Studio and the project itself.

*Users App*

Provides view-only access to the Users admin tool.

*Users Administrator*

Grants full access to the Users admin tool, including create/edit/delete for ID providers, users, roles, and groups.

*Authenticated*

Users automatically get this role when they are logged into the platform, regardless of ID provider.

*Everyone*

A special role that both authenticated users, and visitors (Anonymous user) all have in common.
The role is for instance used to grant read permissions to publicly available content projects.

*Schemas Administrator*

Grants permissions to manipulate virtual applications and schemas.

NOTE:
If you are using <<cms/projects#, Content Projects>>, your project will have a set of <<cms/projects#roles, project-specific roles>> in addition to the built-in ones.
