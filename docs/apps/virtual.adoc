WARNING: This feature is _experimental_ and still under development. It is available for users to test and provide feedback.

Virtual applications lets you create schemas and descriptors without coding. You may even add or override schemas in standard application. 

Virtual application schemas and descriptors data are stored in the XP storage, using the `system.app` repository. Use <<../api/lib-app#, lib-app>> to manipulate virtual applications.


=== Structure
Node structure of a virtual application follows file structure inside the `site` folder of a bundled application:
[source,files]
----
virtual-app/
    site/
      content-types/
      layouts/
      mixins/
      pages/
      parts/
      x-data/
      site.xml
      styles.xml

----
Use <<../api/lib-schema#, lib-schema>> to manipulate schemas and descriptors of virtual apps.

=== Application Mode

Support for Virtual apps must be enabled via XP's <<../deployment/config#application, application config>>.
