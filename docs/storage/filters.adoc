== Introduction

Filters work differently from <<noql#, queries>>.
When searching with a regular query, steps like sorting and scoring are done to produce the result.

These are relatively costly operations.
A filter does none of these steps.
A filter _only_ removes nodes from the result - and is executed after the query statement, if it exists.

As such, filters are the most efficient way of limiting hits when you only need basic comparison statements.


=== Syntax

Filters are defined using a DSL (Domain Specific Language) expressed in JSON.

Below is an example of a filter used in the content-API

.Sample filter usage
[source,javascript]
----
include::code/content-api-query.js[]
----

If specifying several filters on root level, the filters are automatically joined with a boolean "must" clause, meaning all filters much match.

The following filters are supported:

=== exists

The exists filter filter outs any document _not containing_ any values in the given property.

field (string):: The property path

.Sample use of exists filter
[source,json]
----
include::code/exists-filter.json[]
----

=== notExists

The notExists filter removes nodes _containing_ values in the given property.

field (string):: The property path

.Sample use of notExists filter
[source,json]
----
include::code/notExists-filter.json[]
----

=== hasValue

The hasValue filter matches if document contain any of the values given in the value list

field (string)
 The property path

values (object[])
 Array of values to decide a match

.Sample hasValue filter
[source,json]
----
include::code/hasValue-filter.json[]
----

=== ids

The ids filter is a shorthand filter to filter on ids

values (string[])
  Arrays of ids to match

.Sample ids filter
[source,json]
----
include::code/ids-filter.json[]
----


=== boolean

The boolean filter combines functions in logical expressions

must (filter[]):: All functions on the must array must evaluate to true for the filter to match

mustNot (filter[]):: All functions in the mustNot array must evaluate to false for the filter to match

should (filter[]):: One or more of the functions in the should array must evaluate to true for the filter to match
