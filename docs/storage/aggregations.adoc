= Aggregations

== Introduction
With Aggregations, developers may extract statistical data from search results.
Aggregations can be used for anything from data visualization to creating navigational UI's.

Consider a query returning all nodes that have a property "price" less than, say, $100. Now, we want to divide the result nodes into ranges, say 0-$25, $25-$50 and so on. We also would like to know the average price for each category. This could be done by doing multiple separate queries and calculating the average manually, but this would be very inefficient and cumbersome. Luckily, aggregations solve these types of problems easily.

In some API functions it is possible to send in an aggregations expression object. This object is either in Java or a JSON like the following:

There are two different types of aggregations:

Bucket aggregations:: A bucket aggregation places documents matching the query in a collection - a bucket. Each bucket has a key.
Metrics aggeregations:: A metric aggeregation computes metrics over a set of documents.

Typically, you will divide data into buckets and then use metric aggregations to calculate e.g average values,
sum, etc for each bucket, if necessary.


== Term

The `terms` aggregation places documents into bucket based on property values. Each unique value of a property will
get its own bucket. Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.
size (int):: The number of bucket to return, ordered by the given orderType and orderDirection. Default to ``10``.
order (string):: How to order the results, type and direction. Default to ``_term ASC``.
image:xp-770.svg[XP 7.7.0,opts=inline] minDocCount (int):: Only include bucket in result if number of hits is ``minDocCount`` or more. This parameter is optional.

Types:

  * `_term`: Alphabetic ordering of bucket keys.
  * `_count`: Numeric ordering of number of document in buckets.

== Stats

The stats-aggregations calculates the following statistics for the parent-aggregation buckets:

`avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, and `sum`

Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.

== Min

image:xp-770.svg[XP 7.7.0,opts=inline] An aggregation that computes the minimum of the values in the current bucket. Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.

field (string):: The property path.

== Value Count

field (string):: The property path.

== Range

The range aggregation query defines a set of ranges that represents a bucket.
Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.
ranges (range[]):: The range-buckets to create.
range (from: number, to: number):: Defines a range to create a bucket for. From-value is included in bucket, to is excluded.

== geoDistance

The geoDistance aggregation needs a defined range to split the documents into buckets.
Only documents with properties of type 'GeoPoint' will be considered in the ``geoDistance`` aggregation buckets.

Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.
ranges (range[]):: The range-buckets to create.
range (from: number, to: number):: Defines a range to create a bucket for. From-value is included in bucket, to is excluded.
unit (string):: The meassurement unit to use for the ranges.  Legal values are either the full name or the abbreviation of the following: km (kilometers), m (meters), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters), mi (miles), yd (yards), ft (feet) or nmi (nauticalmiles).
origin (lat: number, lon: number):: The GeoPoint from which the distance is measured.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, there is only one way of find out which result belongs to which bucket:
By also sorting the result on geoDistance, and matching the order to the number of each bucket.
In a future version, there will easier ways of doing this.

== dateRange

The dateRange aggregation query defines a set of date-ranges that represents a bucket. Only
documents with properties of type 'DateTime' will considered in the ``dateRange`` aggregation buckets.
Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.
format (string):: The date-format of which the buckets will be formatted to on return. Defaults to ``yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ``.
ranges (range[]):: The range-buckets to create.
range (from: <number>, to: <number>):: Defines a range to create a bucket for. From-value is included in bucket, to is excluded. The from and to follows a special date-math explained below.

=== Date-math expression

The range fields accepts a date-math expression to calculate the time-spans.

* Now minus a day: `now-1d`
* The given date minus 3 days plus one minute: `2014-12-10T10:00:00Z||-3h+1m`
* Range describing now plus one day and thirty minutes, rounded to minutes: `now+1d+30m/m`


== dateHistogram

The date-histogram aggregation query defines a set of bucket based on a given time-unit. For instance,
if querying a set of log-events,  a ``dateHistorgram`` aggregations query with interval ``h`` (hour) will divide each log
event into a bucket for each hour in the time-span of the matching events. Here's a list of properties:

field (string):: The property path.
interval (string):: The time-unit interval for creating bucket. Supported time-unit notations:

  * ``y`` = Year
  * ``M`` = Month
  * ``w`` = Week
  * ``d`` = Day
  * ``h`` = Hour
  * ``m`` = Minute
  * ``s`` = Second

format (string):: Output format of date string.
minDocCount (int):: Only include bucket in result if number of hits <= ``minDocCount``.
