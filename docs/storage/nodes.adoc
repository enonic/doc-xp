= Nodes and repositories

== Introduction

Repositories and nodes are the fundamental concepts that enable you to create and store data in XP. Nodes are the smallest possible data object that can be created, and they are always stored in a repository. A simple comparison might be: If a repository is a drive, nodes are the files (and folders).

== Nodes

Each entry in a repository is called a Node.

A node essentially consist of:

* <<properties#, custom properties>>
* and <<properties#sysprops, system properties>>

When nodes are created in a repository, the following happens:

* For new nodes, a unique identifier is created
* A node identifier is always be unique within its repository
* For every modification, a unique version identifier is created
* The data are persisted the blobstore and instantly indexed.
* The specific version of the node is then added to the specified <<branches#,branch>>

Nodes can also be stored in a hierarchy, meaning they also have a path - similar to a file system.

NOTE: *The root node* Every repository has root node with the identifier `000-000-000-000`, and the fixed path `/`.

== Repositories

Repositories are essentially containers of nodes.
You may create any number of repositories within a single instance of Enonic XP, and even perform queries across them.

Each repository has a unique name, where best practice is to name or prefix the repository according to your application. i.e. a good repository name might be 'com.company.myapp'

Starting from image:xp-7150.svg[XP 7.15.0,opts=inline] you can flag repository as _transient_ meaning that their data is not stored in system dumps and snapshots.

== System repository

The storage ships with a repository known as the system repository.
The system repo is used for the following data:

* Repository metadata - for other repos created within the instance
* Id-providers - including users, groups and roles.
* Application binaries - for apps installed through the API
