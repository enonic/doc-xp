= Upgrading
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images


== Upgrading minor versions
This procedure applies to feature (7.x.0) and fix upgrades (7.x.y, etc).

=== Single instance
To upgrade a single instance deployment:

. stop your instance
. replace your current 7.x runtime image with the new v7.(x+1) image
. restart the instance.

=== Clusters
Clusters can be upgraded without downtime.
The procedure is essentially the same as for a single instance, but repeated for all cluster nodes.
We recommend the following procedure:

. Update only one node at a time. Wait for a node to start and join the cluster before you move on to the next node.
. Upgrade your master nodes first (We always recommend using dedicated master nodes)
. Upgrade all other nodes. If you run a combination of back-end and front-end nodes, we recommend upgrading the back-end nodes before you move on to the front-end nodes.

=== Applications
When upgrading to new feature versions of Enonic XP, new versions of standard apps may also be available. 

After upgrading XP, check for new versions of your installed applications from Enonic market. 
We generally always recommend updating your apps to the latest version!

== v7.4 notes
v7.4 is backward compatible with earlier versions, but if you run XP on a cluster, several configurations need to change for the
nodes to get in touch with each other after the upgrade.  Please do the following:

* Create the configuration file `com.enonic.xp.hazelcast.cfg` and consider the values in it as described in
   <<../deployment/config#hazelcast, com.enonic.xp.hazelcast.cfg>> .
* Open port 5701 between the nodes in the network.  This port is used for all internal communication in the cluster.
An alternate port may be chosen by setting `network.port`.  If using Docker, the port needs to be opened both in the network and in
the `docker-compose.yml` container definition.
* Evaluate the minimum required number of nodes in a cluster.  `system.hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size` is by default set to 2,
but if you have a set-up with dedicated master and data nodes, the minimum should be set to one more than the number of data nodes,
so that at least one master node is required.  The cluster will neither elect a master node nor start XP message communications
until the required number of nodes in the cluster has been reached.


== v7.3 notes
v7.3 is backward compatible with earlier versions, but includes fixes that may affect your existing deployments.

Changed GIF handling:: The image service has been partly broken when processing GIF files. As of 7.3, GIFs are always returned as original files (unprocessed, similar to how SVGs are handled). This means GIFs will no longer be cropped, and always work as expected if they contain animations/videos. Animated GIFs are the most common usage of GIF files today.

Ignite removed:: Ignite (grid memory component) has been part of the XP core for testing purposes, disabled by default. It has now been removed from the XP core. Unless you have enabled Ignite for testing purposes, this will not affect your deployment. Also, all Ignite configuration files and options can now safely be removed.

Content projects:: XP 7.3 introduces the ability to create isolated content repositories. If you have many sites in your current deployment, consider moving your sites into separate projects.

New docker image:: A new, improved and properly documented version of our <<../deployment/docker#, XP7 Docker image>> is now available. The documentation also describes how to upgrade from the old image. 


== v7.2 notes

v7.2 is fully backward compatible with v7.1 and v7.0.

NOTE: This version includes new "Audit logger" feature that requires a new repository. The repository will be created automatically during the upgrade process.


== v7.1 notes

v7.1 is fully backward compatible with v7.0.


== Upgrading to v7.0

=== Requirements

This guide focuses on completing an upgrade with zero downtime, and requires you to set up production environment on XP7 in parallel with existing 6.15 environment.
Carefully follow the below steps to upgrade your instance:

NOTE: For scenarios where downtime cannot be avoided, additional steps, such as setting up a temporary "we are upgrading page", will be required:

Before starting the upgrade process, ensure the following requirements are in place

XP Version:: You need to be running at least Enonic XP 6.15.x (if you are running an older version, upgrade to 6.15.x first)
QA environment:: Ensure you have a QA environment where you can perform a test upgrade first (highly recommended)
Toolbox:: Ensure you have 6.15 Toolbox available
Enonic CLI:: Make sure you have https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli[Enonic CLI] installed
Disk space:: Verify you have enough disk space to facilitate a complete dump of all existing data
3rd party apps:: Verify that all (if any) 3rd party applications in use are upgraded to support XP 7.
Custom apps:: Make sure all custom built applications have been upgraded to support XP 7, as described in <<apps-upgrade#,Upgrading Applications>>


=== 1. Install XP 7

We recommend setting up a new production environment for XP 7, running in parallel with your XP 6 environment.
This will virtually eliminate downtime, and also be a safety net, should the upgrade fail somehow.

Follow the <<../deployment/distro#XP_INSTALL,XP installation instructions>> to set up an instance matching your requirements

==== File deployments
If you have one or more applications deployed as files, replace them with their respective XP 7 versions

==== Vhost config

Vhost configuration has changed:

* `/app` has been renamed to `/webapp`
* `/portal` has been renamed to `/site`
* Repository name is added before the branch in site URL, ie `/site/default/draft`
* `userStore` has been renamed to `idProvider`
* idProvider config format is new

Update your vhost config file as follows:

.Before
[source,properties]
----
include::code/vhost_before.cfg[]
----

.After
[source,properties]
----
include::code/vhost_after.cfg[]
----

==== Port mappings

In XP 7 `/status` and `/api` have been moved to separate dedicated ports: 2609 and 4848 respectively.

Consider how this affects your monitoring and how to expose management API internally.

In `com.enonic.xp.web.jetty.cfg` `http.port` is replaced with `http.xp.port`, `http.management.port` and `http.monitor.port`.

==== Elastic Search discovery

If specifying `discovery.unicast.sockets` in ES configuration: "ip[port]" is now "ip:port"

.com.enonic.xp.elasticsearch.cfg
[source,properties]
----
include::code/com.enonic.xp.elasticsearch.cfg[]
----

==== Other configuration

Migrate other configuration files from 6.15, including custom configurations (app config etc.).

==== Start servers

Start your new servers and verify everything is working properly


=== 2. Dump data

We are now ready to dump data from our existing 6.15 instance.

Readonly mode:: Turn on readonly mode in your 6.15 instance:

    toolbox.sh set-read-only readOnly -a user:password

This will prevent new data from being written to XP during the upgrade, and also ensure a consistent dump.

Dump data:: Use 6.15 toolbox to dump the data:

    toolbox.sh dump -t mydump -a user:password --skip-versions

NOTE:: We highly recommend dumping data without versions. This will dramatically speed up the upgrade while also preparing your dataset for the new vacuuming features in XP 7.


=== 3. Upgrade and Load

Move dump:: Transfer dump files from previous step to the new instance. For clustered environments, any server will do.

NOTE:: Toolbox has been removed from XP 7 and replaced by Enonic CLI.

Upgrade dump:: Before we can load the dump, we need to upgrade the data to support XP 7:

  enonic dump upgrade

Load dump:: Now, load the dump into your XP 7 environment i.e.

  enonic dump load

NOTE: Don't worry about the command losing connection, this is only related to the system repo (and user) being removed during the operation. Watch the log for progress.


=== 4. Install Content studio

Content Studio is no longer part of the XP core distribution.
Content Studio is now available as an https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[application on Enonic Market].
Documentation for Content Studio can be found https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/master[here].

=== 5. Update apps

All installed applications must be updated to latest versions compatible with XP 7.

Market apps:: For market apps, go to the Applications tool, click "Install" in the menu and click "Upgrade" button for all applications where upgrade is available.

Custom apps:: Install XP 7 compatible versions of your custom applications either through the "Install App" UI or by using CLI.


=== 6. Validate

Validate that your new installation is working as expected. We recommend checking logs, and performing live tests on services.


=== 7. Go live

With all lights green, simply redirect all traffic from your old XP 6 servers to the upgraded XP 7 environment.

Welcome to the XP 7 club!
