This section describes the official Enonic XP docker image as well how to configure and run it.

NOTE: This applies to docker images for Enonic XP 7.3 and higher. For migration from versions 7.2 and lower read <<migration>> subsection.

== Quick start

If you just want to try out the image, with no data persistence, you can run this command in your terminal.

NOTE: Running this command requires you to have docker installed.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 enonic/xp:{version}-ubuntu
----

== Image description

=== Goals

The goals of this docker image is to:

* allow people to deploy Enonic XP easily
* be able to run on different container orchestration frameworks
* include the latest security patches for both the JVM and the container OS
* be as light as possible
* help with _day 2 operations_, like backups and JVM debugging
* follow docker best practices

=== Base image

Every time the Enonic XP image is built it will be based off the latest https://hub.docker.com/r/enonic/graalvm[enonic/graalvm] docker image. This ensures the latest updates to the JVM and OS.

=== Enforced best practices

Entrypoint:: The image uses a custom docker entrypoint that is designed to setup file permissions and step down from root user when running Enonic XP.

Builder pattern:: During the build process, all tools used for building the final image are dropped to make the image as light as possible.

File permission:: The image is designed to run on multiple orchestration frameworks and thus supports easily running Enonic XP as an arbitrary user.

=== Preinstalled tools

To help with _day 2 operations_, the image comes with some useful preinstalled tools.

app.sh:: Script to add/remove jars from the Enonic XP deploy folder. An example usage would be `app.sh add <PUBLIC_URL_TO_JAR>`. Description and source https://github.com/enonic/docker-xp/blob/7.15/bin/app.sh[here].

backups.sh:: Convenient script for pre backup hooks to check the age of index snapshots created by the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/snapshotter[snapshotter] app. Description and source available https://github.com/enonic/docker-xp/blob/master/bin/backup.sh[here].

dump.sh:: Easily create JVM heap and thread dump. Description and source available https://github.com/enonic/docker-xp/blob/master/bin/dump.sh[here].

jattach:: A tiny tool to enable creating thread and heap dumps without the full JDK in the image. Description and source available https://github.com/apangin/jattach[here].

== Persisting data

There are several directories storing various data that, depening on your deployment, should be persisted when containers are recreated.

=== Important directories

To create a deployment that is stable and easy to back up you should make the following directories persistent.

$XP_HOME/config:: Configuration files for Enonic XP.

$XP_HOME/deploy:: Apps deployed locally in this particluar container/node.

$XP_HOME/repo/blob:: Enonic XP blobstore.

$XP_HOME/repo/index:: Elasticsearch index.

$XP_HOME/snapshots:: Index snapshots created by the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/snapshotter[snapshotter] app.

=== Other directories

These are directories that, depending on your application of Enonic XP and deployment policy, should maybe be persistent.

$XP_HOME/data:: Various extra data like thread/heap dumps.

$XP_HOME/logs:: Rotating log files from Enonic XP.

$XP_HOME/work:: Various cached files used by Enonic XP, e.g. resized images.

== Configuration

[#java-heap-memory]
=== Heap memory

Since this image uses a modern JVM, it will respect the container memory limits set by the docker daemon. There are some pitfalls though. Elasticsearch uses off-heap buffers, that can lead to the container running out of memory. For that reason, as a general rule, you should:

* set the heap size to `30%` of the available memory to the container
* if the Enonic XP node is a pure master node, set the heap size to `75%` of the available memory to the container
* set minimum and maximum heap size to the same value
* never set heap size over `26 GB`

Parameters to achive this are described under the <<xp-opts>> section.

=== Mounting configuration

The image does contain the standard configuration that comes with all Enonic XP distribution. Depending on how you mount volumes into the container you might override that directory. Consider this command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/host_config_dir:/enonic-xp/home/config enonic/xp:{version}-ubuntu
----

This will override the standard configuration directory with the host directory that might be empty, hence no configuration will be present for Enonic XP. This is probably not what you want. We recommend when you are mounting your configuration directory to the container, that you base it on the standard configuration directory provided in the docker image. To get a copy of the standard configuration run:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker create --name=tmp enonic/xp:{version}-ubuntu
docker cp tmp:/enonic-xp/home/config config
docker rm tmp
----

After running these commands you will have the standard configuration copied to your working directory.

=== Using setenv.sh

The image allows you to supply a custom `setenv.sh` script. It is sourced just before Enonic XP is started and can be used to setup the environment and run pre-scripts. To enable this, simply mount a script to `$XP_HOME/setenv.sh` in the container.

=== Environmental variables

This subsection lists some useful environmental variables to set while deploying this image.

==== Variables specific to this image

TAKE_FILE_OWNERSHIP:: Set this boolean variable to `1` if you want the container to attempt to take file ownership of `$XP_HOME` directory during startup. This should not be used in general but is useful when migrating data between systems. It will only attemt this if the container is run as root. This cannot be set with `setenv.sh`. Defaults to `0`.

XP_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE:: Maximum age of index snapshots in minutes before the `backup.sh` script starts failing. This cannot be set with `setenv.sh`. Defaults to `1440` (24 hours).

==== JAVA_OPTS vs XP_OPTS

Although you can overwrite the default `JAVA_OPTS` it is not recommended. With every distribution the default parameters might be changed to improve performance and by overwriting them, you will not benefit from those changes. Instead we recommend using the environmental variable `XP_OPTS` to pass in your custom JVM parameters.

[#xp-opts]
==== Useful XP_OPTS parameters

In this subection we list some `XP_OPTS` parameters that are useful when running Enonic XP in this image.

===== Memory

Like described in the <<java-heap-memory>> section, you should set the heap memory limits. If your machine has 4GB of memory, and you want to allocate 75% of that to heap memory, do that by adding to `XP_OPTS`.

[source,bash]
----
-Xms3G -Xmx3G
----

===== Heap dumps for OOME

It is useful to make the JVM create a heap dump if the JVM throws an Out Of Memory Exception. Do that by adding to `XP_OPTS`:

[source,bash]
----
-XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/enonic-xp/home/data/oom.hprof
----

===== Remote debugging

When tracking down particulary hard bugs, it can be useful to enable remote debugging. Do that by adding to `XP_OPTS`:

WARNING: This should never be turned on by default and will make your system vulnerable to attacks.

[source,bash]
----
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
----

===== JVM monitoring

When debugging performance issues, it can be useful to attach a profiler to the JVM. Enable that option by adding to `XP_OPTS`:

WARNING: This should never be turned on by default and will make your system vulnerable to attacks.

[source,bash]
----
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3000 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=3000 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=0.0.0.0
----

== Exposed ports

The image has 6 exposed ports:

NOTE: It is important to understand that even though the ports are exposed in the docker image, they will not be accessible unless you publish them with docker.

2609:: Enonic XP metrics port

4848:: Enonic XP management port

5701:: Hazelcast communication port

8080:: Enonic XP server port

9200:: Elasticsearch API port

9300:: Elasticsearch communication port

== Useful commands

=== Create thread dump

[source,bash]
----
docker exec $XP_CONTAINER bash -c 'jattach 1 threaddump > $XP_HOME/data/threaddump.log'
----

=== Create heap dump

[source,bash]
----
docker exec $XP_CONTAINER bash -c 'jattach 1 dumpheap $XP_HOME/data/heapdump.hprof'
----

=== Verify snapshot age

[source,bash]
----
docker exec $XP_CONTAINER bash -c 'backup.sh'
----

== Full example

I this section we will create a single node deployment with `docker-compose`.

NOTE: Running commands this section requires you to have docker and docker-compose installed.

=== Setup

First create a directory called `demo`. Lets get our base configuration, so inside the `demo` directory run the command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker create --name=tmp enonic/xp:{version}-ubuntu
docker cp tmp:/enonic-xp/home/config config
docker rm tmp
----

Next we want to create a `setenv.sh` to install the snapshotter. Create a file called `setenv.sh` inside the `demo` directory.

.setenv.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

# Exit on failure
set -e

echo "Install bootstrap apps"
# Install snapshotter to create index snapshots
app.sh add https://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/app/snapshotter/3.0.2/snapshotter-3.0.2.jar
----

Now we are almost ready. Lastly create a file called `docker-compose.yaml` inside the `demo` directory and paste the following into that file.

.docker-compose.yaml
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
version: '3'
services:
  xp:
    image: enonic/xp:{version}-ubuntu
    restart: always
    environment:
      # Assuming this computer has 4 GB of RAM, set JVM heap to 30% of available heap or 1230 MB. Also enable JVM OOME heap dump
      XP_OPTS: -Xms1230M -Xmx1230M -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/enonic-xp/home/data/oom.hprof
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - blobstore:/enonic-xp/home/repo/blob
      - data:/enonic-xp/home/data
      - deploy:/enonic-xp/home/deploy
      - index:/enonic-xp/home/repo/index
      - snapshots:/enonic-xp/home/snapshots
      - ./config:/enonic-xp/home/config
      - ./setenv.sh:/enonic-xp/home/setenv.sh
volumes:
  blobstore:
  data:
  deploy:
  index:
  snapshots:
----

=== Verifying

Before starting your deployment, you should verify that your `demo` folder contains:

[source,files]
----
demo/
  config/
    com.enonic.xp.app.main.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.app.standardidprovider.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.audit.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.blobstore.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.blobstore.file.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.cluster.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.content.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.elasticsearch.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.extractor.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.hazelcast.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.mail.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.market.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.media.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.repo.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.server.deploy.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.server.shell.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.server.trace.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.server.udc.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.vacuum.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.web.dos.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.web.header.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.web.jetty.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.web.sessionstore.cfg
    com.enonic.xp.web.vhost.cfg
    logback.xml
    README.txt
    system.properties
  docker-compose.yaml
  setenv.sh
----

=== Running

To start up Enonic XP simply run this command in the `demo` directory:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

=== Verify deployment

You can verify that everything is fine by looking at the logs. To do that run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose logs -f
----

You can also open up the admin UI at http://localhost:8080/admin/tool[http://localhost:8080/admin/tool].

=== Summary

Now you have created a single node deployment that is easy to configure, backup and replicate.

You could create a git repository and push the `demo` folder to that repository to version control you deployment. That way if you want to replicate the deployment on another server, simply checkout the git repository on that server and run `docker-compose up -d` again.

You might be wondering where the data for Enonic XP will be stored. Since we defined volumes for it, it will be persisted where docker stores its volumes. That will vary depending on your operating system but on linux they are located at `/var/lib/docker/volumes`. You can query docker to figure out where you volumes are stored like so:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker volume ls --filter 'name=demo_*' --format '{{.Name}}:\t{{.Mountpoint}}'
demo_blobstore: /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo_blobstore/_data
demo_data:      /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo_data/_data
demo_deploy:    /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo_deploy/_data
demo_index:     /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo_index/_data
demo_snapshots: /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo_snapshots/_data
----

To do backups you would simply back up the mountpoints for `demo_snapshots` and `demo_blobstore`. It is not as important to back up other directories.

[#migration]
== Migrating from old image

This image in general does not introduce any breaking changes for the regular user. There are some differences that can potentially break build pipelines that are based off the old image.

=== The binary wget is no longer present

The old image contained the `wget` binary. To keep the image size to a minimum and because `curl` is already present in the new image, `wget` is not installed in the new image.

=== Directory $XP_ROOT/home.org no longer present

The directory `$XP_ROOT/home.org` is now simply called `$XP_ROOT/home`. If you are modifying that directory in your build steps you will have make the appropriate changes.

== Image source code

The source code for the `Dockerfile` and all related scripts is open source and can be viewed https://github.com/enonic/docker-xp[here].
