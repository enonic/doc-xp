= XP distributions

This chapter investigates the anatomy of the XP distribution files (aka the XP runtime)

== XP_INSTALL

When downloading and unzipping the XP distro, you will find the following root structure inside:

.XP distribution folder structure
[source,folders]
----
enonic-xp-<OS>-<type>-<version>  // <1>
 |- bin/  // <2>
 |- home/   // <3>
 |- java/  // <4>
 |- lib/  // <5>
 |- service/  // <6>
 |- system/  // <7>
----

<1> The root folder is simply referred to as XP_INSTALL.
<2> `bin/*` contains the scripts for starting and stopping Enonic XP and setting environment variables.
<3> `home/` also known as <<XP_HOME>>
<4> `java/` contains the embedded Java distro, contents vary with distro
<5> `lib/` contains the bootstrap code used to launch Enonic XP.
<6> `service/` contains install script for Linux to make Enonic XP run as a service
<7> `system/` Default OSGi bundles are placed here.

[#xp_home]
== XP_HOME

By default, this folder structure exists inside the XP_INSTALL.
It is commonly moved out or treated specially from the rest of the files and folders in XP_INSTALL, as it contains stateful data.
An example of this is when using Enonic CLI. Each "sandbox" created is basically a copy of the XP_HOME structure.

You may override the default location of XP_HOME by passing a boot parameter to XP, or by creating an XP_HOME environment variable.

NOTE: Folders marked with * will not appear until XP is started the first time

.Standard folder structure
[source,folders]
----
XP_HOME/
|- config/  // <1>
|- data/ *  // <2>
   |- dump/
   |- export/
|- deploy/  // <3>
|- logs/  // <4>
|- repo/ *
   |- index/  // <5>
   |- blob/  // <6>
|- snapshots/ *  // <7>
|- work/ *  // <8>
----

<1> `config/` holds all configuration files, including vhost.cfg and system.properties. XP supports hot reloading of all files ending with .cfg
<2> `data/` Contains system dumps and exports. 
+
NOTE: Should be mounted to a dedicated volume as usage may grow quickly, and exceed the size of the live repo data. Clusters should use a shared volume.
+
<3> `deploy/` Apps placed here are automatically loaded and started on the specific node.
<4> `logs/` default output location for all logs.
<5> `repo/index/` contains repository metadata and indexes
+
IMPORTANT: Requires a local persisted volume (Preferably using SSD). Must never be mapped to a shared volume. The content is automatically replicated across nodes in the cluster.
+
<6> `repo/blob/` contains the XP blobstore
+
NOTE: Requires a persisted volume. For clusters, this must be a shared volume, accessible by all nodes.
+
<7> `snapshots/` Location where snapshots (of index and metadata) are stored when using the snapshot-operation.
+
NOTE: For clusters, this must be mounted to a shared volume, accessible by all nodes.
+
<8> `work/` Cache and generated bundles (apps etc) are stored here.
+
NOTE: For optimal performance ,mount this to a local persisted volume. Caches do not need to be re-generated after each restart.*
