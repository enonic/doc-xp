Use vhosts to safely expose services (sites/webapps etc) through public domains.

== Service mapping

Vhosts essentially serve two purposes, traffic routing and mapping to ID providers.

A single XP runtime instance may offer multiple services.
By default, XP provides the following endpoints:

* localhost:8080/webapp/<app-name>/ (webapp engine)
* localhost:8080/site/<repo>/<branch>/<path> (site engine)
* localhost:8080/admin/ (admin engine)

By using vhosts, traffic for specific domains and url patterns may be routed directly to defined service paths in XP.

  I.e. example.com -> 8080/site/default/master/homepage

With vhosts enabled, unexposed services are no longer accessible.

Vhosts may also define the relationship to one or more ID providers.
This enables pluggable authentication on a per vhost basis.

NOTE: Vhosts only apply to XP service port (defaults to 8080), not the monitoring and management ports.


== Examples

"Example Inc", the owner of "example.com" just finished building their new site.
The published site is available on `<host>:8080/site/default/master/homepage`.

In this case, a <<./config#vhost,vhost configuration>> looking like this will get the job done:

.Sample vhost config file
[source,properties]
----
enabled = true

mapping.example.host = example.com
mapping.example.source = /
mapping.example.target = /site/default/master/homepage
----

After saving the vhost config file, you should see the following line the XP log:

  2019-05-10 11:34:17,234 INFO  c.e.x.w.v.i.c.VirtualHostConfigImpl - Virtual host is enabled and mappings updated.

NOTE: Each mapping must have a unique mapping identifier, in this case we used `example`.

Also, "Example Inc" wants the admin console deployed on `example.com/admin`.
To solve this, we will simply add another mapping to the config:

[source,properties]
----
mapping.adm.host = example.com
mapping.adm.source = /admin
mapping.adm.target = /admin
mapping.adm.idProvider.system = default
----

[NOTE]
====
This time we also added an ID provider to the mapping.
This effectively activates `system` the default (and only) ID provider for this vhost.
====

== Testing vhosts

To verify that your vhost config is working without setting up proxies or modifying your DNS:
Simply add the following line to your *hosts* file.

  <host-ip-address>     example.com

NOTE: Location of hosts file on Mac/Linux_: `/etc/hosts`, on Windows: `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

Pointing your browser to `\http://example.com:8080` will reveal the glorious result.

Visit the <<./config#vhost,vhost configuration>> section for more details.
