This section describes how to create a clustered XP7 deployments.

We will describe how to setup a <<./strategies#basic_cluster,basic bluster>>, but with little more effort you could create any type of cluster. A __basic cluster__ consists of 3 dedicated XP _master_ nodes and 2 XP nodes that are both backend and frontend nodes _combined_.

== Server setup

NOTE: We assume in this guide that you are deploying version 7.4 or higher of XP that includes __hazelcast__.

To deploy a __basic cluster__, we need 5 servers for XP. You need to ensure that those servers can communicate together on the following ports:

* `5701` for __hazelcast__ cluster communication
* `9300` for __elasticsearch__ cluster communication

You will also need a shared file system for the servers. Read more about that in the <<dirs>> section. If you are using __NFS__ as your shared file system you should also ensure that all XP nodes can communicate to the NFS server on port `2049`. Note that using __NFS__ introduces a single point of failure to the cluster.

Be sure also to setup virtual memory, file descriptors and swap setting correctly for __elasticsearch__. Read more about that in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/setup-configuration.html[elasticsearch documentation].

== XP setup

Setting up XP in a clustered configuration is pretty straight forward, but there are some things to consider.

=== Configuration

There are 3 configuration files that enable cluster setup. Those are:

* `com.enonic.xp.cluster.cfg`
* `com.enonic.xp.elasticsearch.cfg`
* `com.enonic.xp.hazelcast.cfg`

We will set the bare minimum for those files. You can read the <<./config#,Configuration>> documentation for more details.

NOTE: We assume that the IP addresses for the nodes are 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.5.

.com.enonic.xp.cluster.cfg
[source,properties]
----
# Enable cluster and set node name
cluster.enabled=true
node.name=master-1 # This should be different for every node

# Bind to an IP and publish the same IP to other cluster members
network.host=10.0.0.1         # This should be different for every node
network.publish.host=10.0.0.1 # This should be different for every node

# Discover nodes on a comma seperated list of node IPs
discovery.unicast.hosts=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5

# Set cluster name
cluster.name=demo_cluster

# Set node type
node.master=true  # This should only be true on the master nodes
node.data=false   # This should only be true on the data (combined) nodes

# Set minimum master nodes to ((number of master nodes) / 2) + 1
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2

[source,properties]
----
# Set minimum hazelcast cluster size to ((number of total nodes) / 2) + 1
system.hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size=3

=== Java heap

Since XP is using __elasticsearch__ for storage, we have to consider that __elasticsearch__ uses off heap memory buffers. For that reason we cannot allocate all available memory to heap. In general you should:

* Set heap memory to `75%` of available memory on dedicated master nodes.
* Set heap memory to `30%` of available memory on other nodes.
* Never allocat more than `26G` of heap.

You should set the heap memory with the `XP_OPTS` environmental variable. For example, if you want to give XP `512MB` of heap you set `XP_OPTS` to `-Xms512M -Xmx512M`.

=== Java options

You migth want to pass options to the Java virtual machine. Our distributions set the `JAVA_OPTS` variable with defaults for XP to run smoothly. For that reason you should avoid overwriting `JAVA_OPTS` and instead you should use `XP_OPTS` to pass your options.

[#dirs]
=== Directories

As mentioned above, you need a shared file system to run XP in a cluster. The directories that need to be shared are:

$XP_HOME/repo/blob:: Contains all files managed by XP.

$XP_HOME/snapshots:: Contains __elasticsearch__ index snapshots.

$XP_HOME/data:: Contains other data (e.g. system dumps).

You need to mount those specific directories to the shared file system before you start XP.

WARNING: You should never share `$XP_HOME/repo/index` between nodes.

=== Pre-installed apps

You can pre-install apps in XP by placing the jars of those apps to `$XP_HOME/deploy`. We recommend placing the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/snapshotter[snapshotter app] there to enable automatic snapshots.

=== Shard replication

Once your cluster has started you will have to set the number of shard replicas you want the data nodes to store. In this case we have 2 data nodes, so we want 2 copies of each shard in the cluster (1 per data node). To do that we should set the number of replicas to 1. Setting that number to 1 means that the cluster will have 1 primary shard, and 1 replica shard, totalling 2 copies. We can do this with the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[Enonic CLI]:

[source,bash]
----
$ export ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL=10.0.0.1:4848

$ enonic repo replicas 1 --auth user:password
Setting replicas number to 1...Done
{
    "UpdatedIndexes": [
        "storage-system.auditlog",
        "search-com.enonic.cms.default",
        "storage-com.enonic.cms.default",
        "search-system.auditlog",
        "search-system-repo",
        "storage-system-repo"
    ]
}
----

== Backups

Like described in the <<dirs>> section, we have 3 directories that are shared between all the nodes. Of those three, you need to backup two:

* `$XP_HOME/repo/blob`
* `$XP_HOME/snapshots`

With those 2 directories backed up, you can restore the files and indexes from your backups in case of a disaster.

== Loadbalancing

When running XP in a cluster, you should use sticky sessions. That is, the same users should hit the same nodes when calling the cluster. Although XP now supports https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config#sessionstore[session replication] between nodes, the performance will always be better when using sticky sessions in the load balancer.

== Summary

Now you should have a good starting point to create clustered deployments. Just remember these bullet points:

* Do not run nodes on the same physical hardware. That makes the clustered deployment more susceptible to failures.
* Make sure ports `5701` and `9300` is open between all cluster members.
* Setup virtual memory, file descriptors and swap setting on servers correctly.
* Tailor the 3 cluster configuration files to your setup.
* Set heap memory with the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` parameters using the `XP_OPTS` environmental variable.
* Avoid overwriting the `JAVA_OPTS` environmental variable, use `XP_OPTS`.
* Take care of how much memory you allocate to heap. Set it to `30%` of avaliable RAM on all nodes, except if the node is a dedicated master node. Then you can set it to `75%`.
* Directories `$XP_HOME/repo/blob`, `$XP_HOME/snapshots` and `$XP_HOME/data` should be shared between all nodes.
* The `$XP_HOME/repo/index` volume should *never* be shared between nodes.
* Pre-install the snapshotter app for automatic snapshots.
* Set the correct number of replicas after the cluster starts.
* Backup `$XP_HOME/repo/blob` and `$XP_HOME/snapshots`
* Use sticky sessions in your loadbalancer.
