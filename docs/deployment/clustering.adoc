This section describes how to create a clustered XP7 deployment.

== Infrastructure requirements

Enonic XP clusters have basic infrastructure requirements, you will at least need:

* Access to Compute units (VM's or containers)
* Local storage (Volumes)
* A Distributed (or shared) filesystem
* A Load balancer - to make sure traffic is routed to different nodes
 
These components are standard ingredients in most cloud services, or available as software components. An XP cluster can be launched using containers (including Kubernetes), traditional VMs, or even be running on your local computer.

== Basic cluster

In a cluster, each XP node can serve different purposes. In general, these are:

Master node:: Node that helps manage the cluster, and prevent split-brain scenarios
Back-end node:: Node that stores data, but does not handle incoming traffic
Front-end node:: Node that handles incoming traffic, but does not store data 
Combined node:: Node that both stores data, and handles incoming traffic

Throughout this guide, we will describe how to setup a <<./strategies#basic_cluster,basic cluster>>, but with little more effort you could create any type of cluster. A __basic cluster__ consists of 3 dedicated XP _master_ nodes and 2 XP _combined_ nodes.

== Networking

NOTE: This guide assumes that you are deploying XP version 7.4 or higher

To deploy a _basic cluster_, we need a total of 5 nodes for XP. You need to ensure that those servers can communicate on the following ports:

* `5701` for _hazelcast_ cluster communication
* `9300` for _elasticsearch_ cluster communication


== Storage

You will also need access to a shared file system for the servers. Read more about that in the <<dirs>> section. If you are using _NFS_ as your shared file system you should also ensure that all XP nodes can communicate to the NFS server (typically on port `2049`). 

NOTE: Using _NFS_ introduces a single point of failure to the cluster, but has generally proven highly reliable.


== CPU and memory

A combined node running XP should minimum have 4GB of memory and 2vCPU. A general recommendation would be 16GB memory and 4vCPU compute power.

Master nodes can be configured with less memory and capacity as they are generally not processing requests or queries. 

Since Elasticsearch is embedded in XP, be sure also to setup virtual memory, file descriptors and swap setting correctly for __elasticsearch__. Read more about that in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/setup-configuration.html[elasticsearch documentation].

== XP node setup

Setting up XP in a clustered configuration is pretty straight forward, but there are some things to consider.

=== Cluster config

There are 3 configuration files that enable cluster setup. Those are:

* `com.enonic.xp.cluster.cfg`
* `com.enonic.xp.elasticsearch.cfg`
* `com.enonic.xp.hazelcast.cfg`

We will set the bare minimum for those files. You can read the <<./config#,Configuration>> documentation for more details.

NOTE: We assume that the IP addresses for the nodes are 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.5.

.com.enonic.xp.cluster.cfg
[source,properties]
----
# Enable cluster and set node name
cluster.enabled=true
node.name=master-1 # This should be different for every node

# Bind to an IP and publish the same IP to other cluster members
network.host=10.0.0.1         # This should be different for every node
network.publish.host=10.0.0.1 # This should be different for every node

# Discover nodes on a comma seperated list of node IPs
discovery.unicast.hosts=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5

node.data=false   # This should only be true on the data (combined) nodes

# Set minimum master nodes to ((number of master nodes) / 2) + 1
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2
----

[source,properties]
----
# Set minimum hazelcast cluster size to ((number of total nodes) / 2) + 1
system.hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size=3
----

=== Java heap

Since XP is using __elasticsearch__ for storage, we have to consider that __elasticsearch__ uses off heap memory buffers. For that reason we cannot allocate all available memory to heap. In general you should:

* Set heap memory to `75%` of available memory on dedicated master nodes.
* Set heap memory to `30%` of available memory on other nodes.
* Never allocat more than `26G` of heap.

You should set the heap memory with the `XP_OPTS` environmental variable. For example, if you want to give XP `512MB` of heap you set `XP_OPTS` to `-Xms512M -Xmx512M`.

=== Java options

You migth want to pass options to the Java virtual machine. Our distributions set the `JAVA_OPTS` variable with defaults for XP to run smoothly. For that reason you should avoid overwriting `JAVA_OPTS` and instead you should use `XP_OPTS` to pass your options.

[#dirs]
=== Directories

As mentioned above, you need a shared file system to run XP in a cluster. The directories that need to be shared are:

$XP_HOME/repo/blob:: Contains all files managed by XP.

$XP_HOME/snapshots:: Contains _elasticsearch_ index snapshots.

$XP_HOME/data:: Contains other data (e.g. system dumps).

You need to mount those specific directories to the shared file system before you start XP.

WARNING: You should never share `$XP_HOME/repo/index` between nodes.

=== Pre-installed apps

You can pre-install apps in XP by placing the jars of those apps to `$XP_HOME/deploy`. We recommend placing the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/snapshotter[snapshotter app] there to enable automatic snapshots.

NOTE: The pre-installed apps can be placed on distinct nodes, but for instance in the case of the snapshotter app, it should simply be placed on all nodes.

=== Shard replication

Once your cluster has started you will have to set the number of shard replicas you want the data nodes to store. In this case we have 2 data nodes, so we want 2 copies of each shard in the cluster (1 per data node). To do that we should set the number of replicas to 1. Setting that number to 1 means that the cluster will have 1 primary shard, and 1 replica shard, totalling 2 copies. We can do this with the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[Enonic CLI]:

[source,bash]
----
$ export ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL=10.0.0.1:4848

$ enonic repo replicas 1 --auth user:password
Setting replicas number to 1...Done
{
    "UpdatedIndexes": [
        "storage-system.auditlog",
        "search-com.enonic.cms.default",
        "storage-com.enonic.cms.default",
        "search-system.auditlog",
        "search-system-repo",
        "storage-system-repo"
    ]
}
----

== Load balancing

When running XP in a cluster, we generally recommend using sticky sessions. Sticky sessions ensures requests from the same users is always passed to the same node in the cluster. This is due to the following reasons.

. When performing write operations to the NoSQL data store, writing to one node, and then reading from another node immediately afterwards _might_ not provide the result one expects - due to the distributed storage.
. Any kind of node-local file handling will ONLY work across requests if the request is handled by the same node.
. Performance is generally better and more consistent for users

For session-based logins, XP now supports https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config#sessionstore[session replication] between nodes. This effectively prevents users from loosing their session, even when a node is stopped, but this does not mitigate the problems mentioned above.


== Backup and restore

Like described in the <<dirs>> section, we have 3 directories that are shared between all the nodes. Of those three, you need to backup two:

* `$XP_HOME/repo/blob`
* `$XP_HOME/snapshots`

With those 2 directories backed up, you can restore the files and indexes from your backups in case of a disaster.

For more details, check out the <<data#, Data management section>>. 


== Summary

Now you should have a good starting point to create clustered deployments. Just remember these bullet points:

* Do not run nodes on the same physical hardware. That makes the clustered deployment more susceptible to failures.
* Make sure ports `5701` and `9300` is open between all cluster members.
* Setup virtual memory, file descriptors and swap setting on servers correctly.
* Tailor the 3 cluster configuration files to your setup.
* Set heap memory with the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` parameters using the `XP_OPTS` environmental variable.
* Avoid overwriting the `JAVA_OPTS` environmental variable, use `XP_OPTS`.
* Take care of how much memory you allocate to heap. Set it to `30%` of avaliable RAM on all nodes, except if the node is a dedicated master node. Then you can set it to `75%`.
* Directories `$XP_HOME/repo/blob`, `$XP_HOME/snapshots` and `$XP_HOME/data` should be shared between all nodes.
* The `$XP_HOME/repo/index` volume should *never* be shared between nodes.
* Pre-install the snapshotter app for automatic snapshots.
* Set the correct number of replicas after the cluster starts.
* Backup `$XP_HOME/repo/blob` and `$XP_HOME/snapshots`
* Use sticky sessions in your loadbalancer.

== Q&A

=== What are the `INFO c.h.i.diagnostics.HealthMonitor` messages in the log file?

Enonic XP uses Hazelcast for clustering capabilities.
Hazelcast HealthMonitor prints metrics logs when certain values (memory usage and system load) exceed 70% threshold.
It is an indicator of server/cluster capacity problem, if such logs appear often. Occasional HealthMonitor log messages can be safely ignored.
