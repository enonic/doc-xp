XP registers successfully completed actions that affect content, applications, principals and ID providers in the `system.auditlog` repository.

== Principals and ID providers

In order to enable or disable audit logs for actions affecting ID providers and principal entities (such as `users`, `roles` and `groups`) you have to modify configuration file `com.enonic.xp.security.cfg` and set `auditlog.enabled` option to `true` to enable or `false` to disable logging. Default value is `true`.

.com.enonic.xp.security.cfg
[source,properties]
----

auditlog.enabled = true

=== XP registers the following actions for principals and ID providers:

* `system.security.principal.create` - a principal (user, group or role) has been created
* `system.security.principal.update` - a principal (user, group or role) has been updated
* `system.security.principal.delete` - a principal (user, group or role) has been deleted
* `system.security.principal.addRelationship` - a principal joins a group or a role
* `system.security.principal.removeRelationship` - a principal leaves a group or a role
* `system.security.principal.removeRelationships` - all group or role relationships have been removed (deprecated)
* `system.security.principal.setPassword` - new password has been set for a user
* `system.security.idProvider.create` - an ID provider has been created
* `system.security.idProvider.update` - an ID provider has been updated
* `system.security.idProvider.delete` - an ID provider has been deleted

Below you can see some examples of how data is stored for various actions:
