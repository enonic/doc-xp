= HTTP request and response
:toc: right
:imagesdir: ../images

The JavaScript framework defines the following basic HTTP request and response objects:

[#http-request]
== HTTP Request

The following object is passed along with every HTTP request. The object is similar to many traditional request objects, except for two special properties:
mode and branch. These properties are specific to the XP Portal, automatically indicating the contextual branch and rendering mode.

The ``request`` object represents the HTTP request and current context for the
controller.

[source,json]
----
{
  "method": "GET", <!--1-->
  "scheme": "http", <!--2-->
  "host": "enonic.com", <!--3-->
  "port": "80", <!--4-->
  "path": "/my/page", <!--5-->
  "url": "http://enonic.com/my/page?debug=true", <!--6-->
  "remoteAddress": "10.0.0.1", <!--7-->
  "mode": "edit", <!--8-->
  "branch": "master", <!--9-->
  "body": null <!--10-->
  "params": { <!--11-->
    "debug": "true"
  },
  "headers": { <!--12-->
    "Language": "en",
    "Cookies": "mycookie=123; other=abc;"
  },
  "cookies": { <!--13-->
    "mycookie": "123",
    "other": "abc"
  }
}
----

<1> HTTP method of the request
<2> Scheme used to make this request i.e. "http" / "https"
<3> Host name of the server to which the request was sent.
<4> Port of the server to which the request was sent.
<5> Path of the request
<6> URL of the request.
<7> IP address of the client that sent the request. If the X-Forwarded-For footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For] header is set, its value will override the client IP.
<8> Rendering mode (used in site context) one of: ``inline``, ``edit``, ``preview``, ``live``.
<9> Contextual repository branch (used in site context), one of: ``draft``, ``master``.
<10> Optional string value
<11> Name/value pairs of the query/form parameters from the request.
<12> Name/value pairs of the HTTP request headers.
<13> Name/value pairs of the HTTP request cookies.

image:xp-7120.svg[XP 7.12.0,opts=inline] The ``request`` object also has `getHeader(name)` function that reads out a header on the request. The name is case-insensitive.
Use it instead of accessing ``headers`` values directly.

NOTE: Modification of ``headers`` does not affect the result of `getHeader(name)` calls.

[#http-response]
== HTTP Response

The ``response`` object is the value returned by an HTTP controller - as a response to an :ref:`http_request`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": 200, <!--1-->
  "body": "Hello World", <!--2-->
  "contentType": "text/plain", <!--3-->
  "headers": {  <!--4-->
      "key": "value"
  },
  "cookies": {},  <!--5-->
  "redirect": "/another/page",  <!--6-->
  "postProcess": true,  <!--7-->
  "pageContributions": {},  <!--8-->
  "applyFilters": true  <!--9-->
}
----

<1> HTTP response status code (default is ``200``).
<2> HTTP message body of the response that can either be a string or a JavaScript object.
<3> MIME type of the body (defaults to ``text/plain; charset=utf-8``).
<4> Name/value pairs with the HTTP headers to be added to the response.
<5> HTTP cookies to be added to the response. Will be described in a later section.
<6> URI to redirect to. If specified, the value will be set in the "Location" header and the status will be set to 303.
<7> Site engine only: If enabled the response body from a page render is processed to find and render any component tags found. (default is ``true``). Set to false to skip post processing of tags.
<8> Site engine only: Use to contribute html to the resulting response markup. See <<../cms/contributions#, page contributions>> for more information.
<9> Site engine only: If enabled, any defined <<../cms/response-processors#, response processors>> in the pipeline will be executed.

[#http-cookies]
== HTTP Cookies

There are two ways that Http Cookie values can be set in responses (see examples).

Here's an example of how the cookies are set:

[source,javascript]
----
return {
    status: 200,
    body: "Hello World",
    cookies: {
        "plain": "value", <!--1-->
        "complex": { <!--2-->
            value: "value", <!--3-->
            path: "/valid/path", <!--4-->
            domain: "enonic.com", <!--5-->
            comment: "Some cookie comments", <!--6-->
            maxAge: 2000, <!--7-->
            secure: false, <!--8-->
            httpOnly: false, <!--9-->
            sameSite: "Lax" <!--10-->
        }
    }
};
----

<1> If the value is a string then the cookie is created using default settings.
<2> If the value is an object, it will try to apply the settings.
<3> Value (required) The value to store in the cookie. This example will create a cookie looking like this ``complex: value``.
<4> The paths on the site where this cookie should be available from (and all containing paths). Defaults to ``empty``
<5> Add additional sites that should be able to read the cookie. Defaults to ``empty`` (Only the server that creates the cookie can read it.)
<6> A comment describing the cookie. Default to ``null`. Deprecated and will be removed in future versions of XP.
<7> Number of **seconds** before the browser is allowed to delete the cookie. Defaults to ``-1`` (The cookie will live until the browser is shut down.)
<8> Control if the cookie should only be accepted to be created and read over https and similar secure protocols. Defaults to ``false``
<9> Control if the cookie is available for scripts or not. If `true`, only the serverside code can read the cookie. Defaults to ``false`` (Also client-side scripts can read the cookie.)
<10> image:xp-730.svg[XP 7.3.0,opts=inline] SameSite flag for the cookie. Can be `lax`, `strict`, `none` or `&nbsp;` for "not set". Default is "not set", meaning "browser's default".
