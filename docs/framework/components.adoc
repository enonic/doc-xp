Special controllers used to render page components.

NOTE: Component controllers are only used in context of the <<../runtime/engines/site-engine#, Site Engine>>

== Introduction

TIP: For a hands on introduction to rendering pages with the Enonic framework, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/my-first-site[My first site tutorial].

Component controllers are 1:1 aligned with their respective <<../cms/pages#, page component definitions>> and must also be placed in specific locations within the code structure.

They have the same capabilities as regular <<controllers#, controller>>, you may take advantage of <<contributions#, page contributions>>, and the fact that they are always executed in the context of a content item. 

IMPORTANT: Markup response from a component must have a single root element.


== Context

Component rendering is initiated by the <<../runtime/engines/site-engine#, Site Engine>>. The controllers are derived when a client requests a specific page via the site engine:

`HTTP request` -> `/site/<project>/<branch>/path/to/content` -> `resolve component` -> `execute controller`.

This means you will always have a specific content item in your context. 

API functions such as <<../api/lib-portal#getContent, portalLib.getContent()>>, and <<../api/lib-portal#getComponent, portalLib.getComponent()>> will automatically return values based on the context.

TIP: Thanks to the site engine's built-in access control you are also guaranteed that the current user has read permissions to the contextual content item.

== Page controllers

Page controlles must be placed next to your <<../cms/pages#, page descriptor>> i.e. `src/main/resources/site/pages/<page-name>/<page-name.js>`.

.Sample page controller using the context
[source,javascript]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

exports.get = function(req) {

  const content = portal.getContent();
  return {
    body: `<html>
            <body>
              <h1>${content.displayName}</h1>
            </body>
          </html>`
  };
};
----

== Part controllers

Part controlles must be placed next to your <<../cms/pages/parts#, part descriptor>> i.e. `src/main/resources/site/parts/<part-name>/<part-name.js>`.

.Sample part controller using the form value
[source,javascript]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

exports.get = function(req) {

  const config = portal.getComponent();
  return {
    body: `<div>
              <h1>${config.heading}</h1>
          </div>`
  };
};
----

== Layout controllers

Layout controlles must be placed next to your <<../cms/pages/layouts#, layout descriptor>> i.e. `src/main/resources/site/layouts/<layout-name>/<layout-name.js>`.


.Sample layout using Thymeleaf to render two regions
[source,js]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function (req) {
    var component = portal.getComponent();

    return {
        body: thymeleaf.render(resolve('./layout-two-column.html'), {
            leftRegion: component.regions["left"],
            rightRegion: component.regions["right"],
        })
    };

};
----

.Thymeleaf view to render layout
[source,HTML]
----
<div class="row">
  <div data-portal-region="left">
    <div data-th-each="component : ${leftRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div data-portal-region="right">
    <div data-th-each="component : ${rightRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

== Regions

Component hierarcies are created via <<../cms/pages/regions#, regions>>. Rendering a region essentially boils down to rendering the components of that region.

To render a component, simply leave a component placeholder in your page or layout's response markup. Component placeholders are then identified and rendered by the <<../../runtime/sites/site-engine#, component rendering>> step of the site engine. 

As components may contain new regions, with new placeholders, this process will be repeated until there are no more placeholders left in the response.

=== Component Placeholders

Placeholders are formatted as HTML comments - and includes the component path. Like this example:

`<!--# COMPONENT /main/0/left/1 -\->`

For `text/html` responses, the site engine will look for component placeholders. For each placeholder, the component's controller is executed and the output merged into the response. 


=== JavaScript example

A basic approach to rendering the main region of a page might look something like this:

.Manually create component placeholders
[source, javascript]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

exports.get = function(req) {

  // Get components of the main region
  const content = portal.getContent();
  const components = content.page.regions["main"].components || [];

  // Render with placeholders
  return {
    body: `<html><head>Placeholder demo</head>
            <body>
              <main data-portal-region="main">
                ${components.map((c) => `<!--# COMPONENT ${c.path} -->`).join('\n')}
              </main>
            </body>
          </html>`
  };
}
----

=== Templating example

Using Thymeleaf templating, placeholder generation might look like this:

.Page controller passing region to template
[source, javascript]
----
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function(req) {

  var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

  // Get the contextual content item
  var content = portal.getContent();
  var mainRegion = content.page.regions["main"];

  // Render and return the result
  return {
    body: thymeleaf.render(view, mainRegion);
  };
}
----

.Thymeleaf template creating placeholders
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Page with placeholders</h1>
    <main data-portal-region="main">
      <div data-th-each="component : ${mainRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
        <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
----

== Fragments

Fragments essentially rendered via their existing controllers. However, as fragments are just subsets of a page, the will likely be rendered without any styling, header or footer.

To mitigate this, the recommended approach is adding a controller mapping to help spice up the visual appearance.


Add a <<mappings#, controller mapping>> for the `portal:fragment` content type. This will then be executed every time a fragment is rendered.

.site.xml
[source, XML]
----
<mapping controller="/site/pages/default/default.js">
  <match>type:'portal:fragment'</match>
</mapping>
----

NOTE: It can often be convenient to reuse your page controller, as this is already doing the job.

In the markup produced by the controller, leave a placeholder for the fragment:

`<!--# COMPONENT / -\->`

The site engine will then render the fragment's components here.

Using Thymeleaf, the placeholder may be generated with the following line of code:

[source, HTML]
----
<div data-portal-component="fragment" data-th-remove="tag"/>
----


== Text controllers

Unlike the other components types, <<../cms/pages/text#, Text components>> are built-in to XP. This includes a standard controller that will render the component.

NOTE: Optionally bypass the built-in controller by running your own code rather than creating a placeholder for the text components.
