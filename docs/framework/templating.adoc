= Templating

Templates engines may be used to simplify output generation from controllers. 

== Introduction

Enonic XP does ship with a standard templating engine, but supports use of 3rd party engines. In this section we give examples of how you may use templating engines with your controllers.

NOTE: A range of integrated templating engines are available as https://market.enonic.com/libraries[libraries on Enonic Market].


== React / JSX

Enonic offers a solution for server-side rendering with JSX React templates. Details are available in a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp[separate tutorial called React4XP].


== Thymeleaf

Here we will demonstrate templating using the https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html[Thymeleaf] templating engine. Thymeleaf is available as an https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/thymeleaf-lib[Enonic library]. 

TIP: For a more extensive tutorial using Thymeleaf, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/my-first-site[My first site tutorial]


Start by including the library in your app:

.build.gradle
[source, gradle]
----
dependencies { 
   include 'com.enonic.lib:lib-thymeleaf:<version>' 
}
----

NOTE: Replace <version> with the version of the library you want to use.


Add a template file to your project:

.src/main/resources/views/sample-view.html
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
    <h2>Hello <span data-th-text="${name}">World</span></h2>
  </body>
</html>
----

Your controller must then be updated to use the template:

.Example controller using Thymeleaf
[source, javascript]
----
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function(req) {

  // Resolve the view
  var view = resolve('/view/my-template.html');

  // Define a model
  var model = {
    name: "John Doe"
  };

  // Render a thymeleaf template
  var body = thymeleaf.render(view, model);

  // Return the result
  return {
    body: body,
    contentType: 'text/html'
  };

};
----

Unlike some controller files, templates may reside anywhere within the `src/main/resources` structure of your project.

If the view file is in the same folder as your controller, it can be resolved with only the file name `resolve('my-template.html')`. Otherwise, the full or relative path should be used.
