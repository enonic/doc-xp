= Mappings
:toc: right
:imagesdir: ../images

Map controllers or filters to specific content types, site relative URLs, or system services.

NOTE: Mappings are only available when using the <<../runtime/engines/site-engine#, Site Engine>>

== Introduction

Mappings are the first processing step in the <<../runtime/engines/site-engine#, site engine>> - and happens before page rendering starts. You may define mappings for both <<controllers#, controllers>> and <<filters#,filters>>. The use cases are vast. 

== Usage

Mappings are defined in the <<../cms/sites#site_xml, site descriptor>>. Examples of use cases are:

* Map a controller to a specific URL pattern i.e. /mypath
* Map a controller to a specifc set of content through content matches, i.e. only apply to the `portal:fragment` content type
* Map a filter to parts of or the entire site structure

  <mappings>
    <mapping controller="/site/foobar/api.js" order="10"> // <1> <2>
      <pattern>/api/v\d+/.*</pattern>  // <3>
    </mapping>
    <mapping controller="/site/pages/default/default.js">
      <match>type:'portal:fragment'</match>  // <4>

    <mapping filter="/site/foobar/filter.js" order="10">  // <5>

    </mapping>

  </mappings>

<1> *@controller* defines the path to a standard <<../framework/controllers#, HTTP controller>>
<2> *@order* defines the <<Execution order>> across apps. Default is `50`. A lower number means higher priority.
<3> *<pattern>* specifies a regular expression based site contextual URL <<Patterns>>. Default is `/.*`
<4> *<match>* a property condition to evaluate <<Matches>> for the contextual content.
<5> *@filter* defines the path to the <<../framework/filters#, HTTP filter>>
<6> *@service* specifies a system service which will be handled by the filter i.e. (`.../_/image/...` endpoint).

NOTE: Each mapping may exclusively specify a filter OR a controller, and it must define at least one pattern or match setting.

=== Execution order

An application may contain multiple mappings, and multiple applications can be added to a site.

If two different apps within a site has the same mapping path or match expression,
the mapping with the *lower* `order` value is used.

In case there are several mappings with the same `order` value, the sort order of the applications on the site determines which mapping will be used.

== Pattern mappings

Pattern based mappings can for instance be used to take over the request for a specific URL before it reaches the content rendering.
An example use case is exposing an API endpoint on the contextual URL /api, or triggering a filter to execute for every request within the site.

The `<pattern>` element specifies a regular expression to be matched against the request URL.

The part of the URL that is taken into account for the matching is the path relative to the site where the application is configured.
For example, if a site is deployed via the virtual host `example.com/mysite/`, then the pattern ``<pattern>/api/.*</pattern>`` will match with requests with URL ending in `example.com/mysite/api/.*`
The protocol, host and port are not involved in the pattern matching.


If the pattern contains the question mark ``?`` character, the URL to match will also include query parameters.
The query parameters will be normalized, so they are always in alphabetical order.

For example the pattern `<pattern>/api\?category=foo&amp;key=\d+</pattern>` will match with both:

* `/api?category=foo&key=123`
* and `/api?key=123&category=foo`

[NOTE]
====
In the previous example the question mark character `?` is escaped with a backslash because the question mark is a quantifier in regular expressions.
And also the ampersand character `&` needs to be XML-escaped because the pattern string is in an XML.
Another alternative to XML-escape is to wrap the string in a CDATA block, as in the example below.
====

A pattern element may also contain an *@invert* attribute to indicate that the result of evaluating the regular expression should be negated i.e.: `<pattern invert="true">`

The pattern string must be a valid https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java regular expression].

Examples:

* Anything ending with .json within the /api/* path: `<pattern>/api/.*\.json</pattern>`
* All items within the site, including site itself: `<pattern>/.*</pattern>`
* Regular expression pattern: `<pattern>/endpoint\?bar=\d+&amp;foo=.*</pattern>`
* Regular expression encapsulated in CDATA to avoid XML encoding: `<pattern><![CDATA[/endpoint\?bar=\d+&foo=.*]]></pattern>`
* Inverted with invert option enabled: `<pattern invert="true">/section/.*</pattern>`

NOTE: Before image:xp-780.svg[XP 7.8.0,opts=inline] it was not possible to map controller or filter to the site itself.

== Match mappings

Match based mappings can for instance be used to automatically render content types without using page templates or associating content with a controller directly.
An example use case is automatic handling of the content type `portal:fragment`.

The `<match>` element specifies a condition related to the content corresponding with the requested URL path.

The condition takes the form of a property path followed by a `:`, and a value.

The property path can be one of the content properties (``_id``, ``_name``, ``_path``, ``type``, ``displayName``, ``hasChildren``, ``language``, ``valid``) or any other custom property within the content

Examples:

* Match fragment content type: `<match>type:'portal:fragment'</match>`
* Match content within the features/ path: `<match>_path:'/features/.*'</match>`
* Match custom property with string value `<match>data.employee.type:'developer'</match>`
* Match custom property with a number: `<match>data.product.category:42</match>`
* Match custom property with a boolean: `<match>x.com-enonic-myapp.menuItem.show:true</match>`
* Match any content: `<match>type:'.+'</match>`

The expected value can be either a regular expression to match the property value, or simply a string, number or boolean (`true` | `false`).

NOTE: image:xp-780.svg[XP 7.8.0,opts=inline] Missing/unavailable content does not match any condition.
Don't specify `<match>` if you need to map controller/filter to the URL that does not correspond to any content.

== Service mappings
image:xp-7120.svg[XP 7.12.0,opts=inline]

Service-based mappings can be used to associate service requests with controllers or filters directly.

Supported services: `image`, `attachment`, and `component`.

Examples:

* `<service>component</service>`

Allows to filter or redirect to a controller rendering of contextual page components on URLs like `<host>:<port>/site/<repo>/<branch>/<path-to-page>/_/component/<component-path>`

* `<service>image</service>`

Allows to filter or redirect to a controller rendering of images on URLs like `<host>:<port>/site/<repo>/<branch>/<path-to-content>/_/image/<image-path>`
