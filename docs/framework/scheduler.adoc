Named <<tasks#, tasks>> can be scheduled by XP platform to asynchronously run in the background in a cluster or a one-node environment.

== Scheduled Job

A scheduled job is an object which describes how a named task must be run. It contains information about the type of scheduling, time of execution, description, etc. All job nodes are stored in a separate `system.scheduler` repository.  See how to manipulate it with <<../api/lib-scheduler#, lib-scheduler>> API.

== Calendar
Calendar object describes when and how the task should be run. There are two possible types: one-time and cron.

[#one-time]
.one-time
The task will be run only once. If the time value is passed at the moment of scheduling, then the task will be run immediately. Value format is https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_INSTANT[ZULU] time, documented in ISO 8601.

.Example of a one-time calendar
[source,javascript]
----
{type: 'ONE_TIME', value: '2021-01-01T10:30:00.00Z'}
----

[#cron]
.cron
Should be used for repeatable tasks. http://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/5/crontab[UNIX] cron lib format is expected. Also, a timezone must be specified to run the job at a particular time of the day.

.Example of a cron calendar
[source,javascript]
----
{type: 'CRON', value: '* * * * *' // every minute
,timeZone: 'GMT+5:30'}
----

== Configuration
There are two ways to configure custom scheduled jobs: <<../api/lib-scheduler#, lib>> API provides methods to manipulate jobs and <<../deployment/config#scheduler, config>> file is used to configure default permanent cron jobs.

== System jobs
XP platform provides predefined system jobs, which can be enabled and overridden by user in <<../deployment/config#scheduler, config>> file. Config modification doesn't update job nodes automatically, so make sure you've removed or changed old job nodes manually before any config change.

.Vacuum
Deletes unused blobs and binaries from a blobstore.

WARNING: Make sure you have a backup of the installation available before doing a vacuum.

.Audit log cleanUp
Deletes records from audit log repository.

WARNING: Make sure you have a backup of the installation available before running a cleanUp.

----

== Distributable
XP platform guarantees that a scheduled job won't be executed by multiple threads concurrently for the cluster environment.

NOTE: Several jobs can describe the same task descriptor, so the same code can be run by different threads simultaneously. Also, if the execution time of the task is longer than the cron period (especially important for long-term jobs) then a new task can be started before the previous is finished.

A scheduled job can be executed by any cluster node supporting an application, which contains the described task. See <<tasks#distributable, task>> for further explanation.
