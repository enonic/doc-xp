Localizing your projects

== Use cases

NOTE: This section applies to code level localization, not multi-lingual content and websites.

Any project targeting users with different languages, you may want to localize the interface.

The XP framework provides localization for the following use-cases:

CMS/Sites::  Use the <<../api/lib-i18n#,the localization API>> to dynamically localize any text phrases in your app. The framework will attempt to apply the locale specified in the site's language property.

Admin Console:: Localise labels and texts in <<../cms/schemas#schema_localization, schemas>> such as content types. The framework will attempt to use the locale derived from the browser's "accept-language" settings.

Webapps and more:: The <<../api/lib-i18n#,the localization API>> may also be used for any other purpose. In these cases, the developer must control and explicitly specify locale.

== Localization files

The localization files are plain text files, using the `properties` format (key = value). 
The files must be placed in a specific project folder: `/src/main/resources/i18n/`.

Imagine, making an app that should support the following localizations.

* 'English' (en)
* 'English US' (en-US)
* 'New Norwegian' (nn)
* 'New Norwegian Norway' (nn-NO)

Each locale then needs to have a matching localization file, in the format:

  phrases[_LOCALE].properties

NOTE: The API's country codes use `-` as separator but the files use `_`.

.Sample localization bundle
[source, properties]
----
i18n/phrases.properties
i18n/phrases_en_US.properties
i18n/phrases_no.properties
----

This format and packaging is commonly known as "property bundles".

CAUTION: The filenames are case sensitive!

== Locale format

A locale is composed of two-letter codes for language, country and variant.
Language is required, country and variant are optional.

For the property files, all codes are case sensitive and separated by and underscore (_).

The string-representation of a locale is::

  la[_CO][_VA]

where

* `la`= two letter language code as specified by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes[ISO-639]
* `CO` = optional two-letter country code as specified by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes[ISO-3166]
* `VA` = two letter rarely used variant-code.

A sample locale including vendor specific variant:

  es_ES_Traditional_WIN"..

NOTE: Variants are rarely used in XP, and can pretty much be discarded.

== Best match resolving

Based on the requested locale to be used, the framework applies the best matching pattern to find the optimal localization file.

If the requested locale is "en-US", the XP framework will look for localization files in the following order:

* ``phrases_en_US.properties``
* ``phrases_en.properties``
* ``phrases.properties``

As such, if the locale for a request was ``en``, the ``phrases_en.properties`` file would be used.

If the locale does not match any specific file, the default ``phrases.properties`` will be used as fallback.

If no matching localization key is found in any of the files in a bundle, a default ``NOT_TRANSLATED`` will be displayed.


=== Encoding and special characters

Property keys:: Must be in the ISO-8859-1 range, also known as Latin-1 characters. Non-Latin-1 characters use Unicode escape characters, e.g \u00E6 for the Norwegian letter 'æ'.

Property values:: Supports any unicode characters

NOTE: We always recommend saving property files using the UTF charset.


== Sample

Below is an example of what a property file might look like

.phrases.properties
[source,properties]
----
user.greeting = Hello there!
message = Good to see you. How are you doing?
with_\u00e6_\u00f8_\u00e5 = This key contains norwegian characters æ, ø and å
----

== Placeholders

The properties format also supports parameter values that can be merged into the localized strings.
Below is an example of what this might look like:

.phrases.properties
[source,properties]
----
user.greeting = Hello, {0}!
message_url = http://localhost:8080/{0}
message_multi_placeholder = My name is {0} and I live in {1}
message_placeholder = Hello, my name is {0}.
----

Placeholders are marked with ``{<number>}``.
The given number corresponds with the function argument named ``values`` and the position of the parameter.

See Java documentation for https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/MessageFormat.html[MessageFormat] for advanced use of placeholders.
The only difference with Java MessageFormat implementation is that DateFormat timezone is `UTC`.
