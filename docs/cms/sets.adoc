= Sets

To enable building more complex forms by grouping inputs together into nested structures, Enonic XP supports the following types of sets:


=== Field Set

TIP: Schema description of a fieldset can be found <<schemas#fieldset, here>>.

A field set may be used to group items visually under a common label and distinguish this group from the rest of the form.

=== Item Set

TIP Schema description of an item set can be found <<schemas#itemset, here>>.

Item sets enable combining inputs (or other sets) into complex, nested structures.
Item sets are grouped both visually and semantically, as the name of the item set is used in the persisted property structure.

A new or a single occurrence of an item set is by default expanded and can be collapsed by a click anywhere inside the item set header.
Multiple occurrences of an item set will be collapsed by default to ensure better readability of a form containing several occurrences of complex item sets.

Label of an item set will dynamically change to value of the first non-empty field inside the set.

This helps to distinguish between multiple collapsed occurrences of the same item set without having to expand them.

Context menu of an item-set occurrence can be used to add a new occurrence of the set above or below the current one, or delete current occurrence.
Add/delete actions can be disabled based on the item set's occurrence configuration.

Item sets can be nested inside each other.
