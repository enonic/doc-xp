Visually add and edit rich text within a region.

== Introduction

Text are built-in components that require no further configuration. They are essentially pre-configured instances of the <<../../schemas/input-types/htmlarea#, HtmlArea input types>>, adapted to work as components in the page editor.

== Usage

Below is an example of the Text component in action via the page editor. The blue box is a text component being edited:

== Rendering

NOTE: Text components have specific requirements for styling and HTML output. They are optimized for use in combination with the <<../../framework#, Enonic Framework>>. Consider implementing <<parts#, parts>> with an HtmlArea input when using 3rd party frameworks.
