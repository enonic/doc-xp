Create independent content repositories for your different teams and projects.


== Introduction

Content projects represent the starting point of XP's CMS. In order to create sites and content, you first need to create a project. Project defines default permissions and other useful settings for your content and editors.

== Project settings

=== Basics
* Display name - a human readable name
* Identifier - a unique id within the installation. Cannot be changed when first created
* Default language - Specifies the default language for content created in the project

=== Access mode

Project access mode defines default read permissions for it's content.
The available values are:

* Public (Everyone can read the content)
* Private (only users with project roles can read the content)
* Custom (a specific list of principals can be granted access to read the content, i.e. Employees)

To handle private and custom mode, a special "viewer" role is created and given read access to the content items.

[#roles]
=== Roles

To provide access to a project or manage it, users can be granted special roles.
The following roles are available per project:

* Contributor - Access to project and issues (must be given specific permissions to create or manage any content)
* Author - Same as contributor, but can additionally create and update content anywhere in the structure
* Editor - Same as Author, but with full permissions and access to rich-text editor source mode
* Owner - Same as Editor, but can also manage the project settings

For each project, dedicated principal roles are created. The roles are named as follows:
`com.enonic.cms.project.<id>.<roletype>`

An example might be com.enonic.cms.myproject.author.

=== Applications

Applications can be assigned directly to a content project. Most functionality, schemas (content types, mixins, x-data) as well as controller mappings be available within the scope of the project, until a site item appears.

Unlike sites, content at project level does not support pages, fragments and page page templates, so content preview and rendring must be done directly via <<../framework/mappings#, Mappings>>.

It is also worth noting that configurations of applications assigned to a project will be published instantly - unlike changes to a site.

IMPORTANT: Sites override project applications. If a site should use an application already assigned to its project, you must assign the application directly to the site.

<<layers#, Layered projects>> inherit application settings from parent layers, just like .

NOTE: Sites inside the project are isolated and have no access to project's or each other's apps.

== Storage

Another important purpose of projecs is to strictly isolate the content from other projects.
As such, each project gets a dedicated <<../storage#, repository>>.

This means, that editors of a particular project will not be able to see, use or link to content within other projects.

== Site engine

<<../runtime/engines/site-engine#, Site engine>> provides access to content in a specific branch of a specific project at `/site/{projectId}/{branch}`, where `{projectId}` is a unique project identifier. For example, draft items of a project with identifier ´myproject´ can be accessed via internal path `/site/myproject/draft`.

== API

To programmatically manage projects, use the <<../api/lib-project#, project API>>
