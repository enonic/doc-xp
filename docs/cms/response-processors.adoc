= Response processors
:toc: right

A response processor is a special filter that only runs at response time, earlier than other filters in the pipeline.

NOTE: Consider using regular <<../framework/filters#, HTTP Filters>> as an alternative if you are not planning to use <<contributions#, page contributions>>.

== Introduction
Response processors are executed after the post processing steps, and before the contributions filter in the site engine pipeline.

Common use cases for response processors are:

* Dynamically adding page contributions (i.e. script tags)
* Manipulation of the response i.e. headers or body

== Processors

To create a page processor, simply place a controller file in you project folder `src/main/resources/site/processors` i.e. `src/main/resources/site/processors/myprocessor.js`

The controller must export a `responseProcessor`.
The export receives the request and response objects as parameters and must return a response object as done in <<../framework/controllers#, HTTP Controllers>>.

Below is an example that dynamically adds a `bodyEnd` <<contributions#, page contribution>> to the response.

.processors/tracker.js
[source,js]
----
exports.responseProcessor = function (req, res) {
    var trackingScript = '<script src="http://some.cdn/js/tracker.js"></script>';

    // Check if contribution field exists, if not create it
    var bodyEnd = res.pageContributions.bodyEnd;
    if (!bodyEnd) {
        res.pageContributions.bodyEnd = [];
    }

    // Add contribution
    res.pageContributions.bodyEnd.push(trackingScript);

    return res;
};
----

== Trigger

In order to actually be executed, the processor must be declared in the app's <<sites#site_xml, site descriptor>>:

.site.xml
[source,xml]
<site>
  <processors>
    <response-processor name="tracker" order="10"/> // <1> <2>
  </processors>
  <form/>
</site>
----

<1> @name indicates name of the controller file
<2> @order indicates execution order, as described below

Response processors may change any of the values of the response object, that includes: HTTP status code, response body, HTTP headers, cookies and page contributions.
It is also possible to return the response object received without any changes.

== Execution order
An application may contain multiple processors.
Multiple applications can be added to a Site.
When a page is rendered, all processors are ordered and executed accordingly.

The order of execution is determined by the `order` value (as defined in the <<sites#site_xml, site descriptor>>) combined with the order of the application list within the site.

Processors with a *lower* order will be executed first (across all apps within the site).
In case there are several filters with the same ``order`` number,
the position of the applications (as configured on the site) determines the order of execution.

NOTE: If `applyFilters` is set to `false` in the <<../framework/http#http-response, response object>>, the response processing will be stopped. Default value is `true`.
