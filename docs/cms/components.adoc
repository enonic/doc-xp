= Page components
:toc: right
:imagesdir: ../images

Pages are composed from a set of editorially manageable components.

== Regions
Regions are not strictly components themselves, but enable placement of components, kind of like a folder.
Regions have a fixed name, that is known to the component the region belongs to.

In Content Studio, regions are visually displayed as "dropzones" for components.

To exist, regions must actually be defined within another component. This definition is placed within the application code.
Only page and layout components support regions.

[#pages]
== Page

The page component is always the root entry of any component structure.
A page component may define zero, one, or multiple regions. Each region must have a unique name.

Conventionally, pages define a single region called "main".

To create a page component you must create the following files and folders in your project structure:

.page component project structure
[source,js]
----
/src/
  main/
    resources/
      site/
        pages/
          <component-name>/
            <component-name>.js
            <component-name>.xml
----

Replace <component-name> with your preferred name.

NOTE: The name you choose for a component will be used in the underlying data of the stored page. So choose your name wisely.

=== Page descriptor

The xml file placed in the component structure serves several purposes.

.Example page descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<page>
  <display-name i18n="component.page.name">My first page</display-name> <!--1--> <!--2-->
  <description>Front page of our site</description> <!--3-->
  <form/> <!--4-->
  <regions>
    <region name="main"/> <!--5-->
  </regions>
</page>
----

<1> *display-name* provides a display name used by the editorial interface
<2> *display-name/i18n* optionally specify localization key
<3> *description* Description field shown when creating a part in content studio
<4> *form* allows the definition of a configuration form based on the <<schemas#,schema system>>
<5> *region* optionally specify regions for the page

=== Page controller

A page controller handles requests to the page. The controller is a required file written in JavaScript and must be
named ``[page-name].js``. A controller exports a method for each type of HTTP request that should be handled.
The handle method has the request object as a parameter and returns the response object.

.Example page controller
[source,javascript]
----
// Handles a GET request
exports.get = function(req) {}

// Handles a POST request
exports.post = function(req) {}
----

Here's a simple controller that acts on the ``GET`` request method.

.Example simple get request
[source, javascript]
----
exports.get = function(req) {

  return {
    body: '<html><head></head><body><h1>My first page</h1></body></html>',
    contentType: 'text/html'
  };

};
----

*Render-view*

If you feel like concatenating strings to create an entire web page is a
little too much hassle, Enonic XP also supports views. A view is rendered
using a rendering engine; we currently support XSLT, Mustache and Thymeleaf
rendering engines. This example will use Thymeleaf.

To make a view, create a file ``my-first-page.html`` in the ``view`` folder.

.Example view file
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
----

In our ``[page-name].js`` file, we will need to parse the view to a string for
output. Here is where the Thymeleaf engine comes in. Using the Thymeleaf
rendering engine is easy; here is how we do it.

.Example controller with thymeleaf
[source, javascript]
----
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function(req) {

  // Resolve the view
  var view = resolve('/site/view/my-first-page.html');

  // Define the model
  var model = {
    name: "John Doe"
  };

  // Render a thymeleaf template
  var body = thymeleaf.render(view, model);

  // Return the result
  return {
    body: body,
    contentType: 'text/html'
  };

};
----

Unlike controllers and descriptors, view files can reside anywhere in your project
and have any valid file name. This allows for code reuse as
multiple page components can share the same view. If the view file is in the same
folder as the page controller then it can be resolved with only the file name
``resolve('file-name.html')``. Otherwise, the full path should be used, starting
with a '/' as in the example above.


*Dynamic-content*

We can send dynamic content to the view from the controller via the ``model``
parameter of the ``render`` function. We then need to use the rendering engine
specific syntax to render it. The controller file above passed a variable
called ``name`` and here is how to extract its value in the view using
Thymeleaf syntax.

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
    <h2>Hello <span data-th-text="${name}">World</span></h2>
  </body>
</html>
----

More on how to use Thymeleaf can be found in <<https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html#,the official Thymeleaf documentation>>

*Regions*

To be able to add components like images, component parts, or text to our page via the Page Editor drag and drop interface, we need to create at least one region. Regions can be declared in the page descriptor. Each region will be referenced by name.

.Example regions in a [page].xml
[source, xml]
----
<page>
  <display-name>My first page</display-name>
  <form />
  <regions>
    <region name="main"/>
  </regions>
</page>
----

You will also need to handle regions in the controller.

.Example page controller using regions
[source, javascript]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

// Get the current content. It holds the context of the current execution
// session, including information about regions in the page.
var content = portal.getContent();

// Include info about the region of the current content in the parameters
// list for the rendering.
var mainRegion = content.page.regions["main"];

// Extend the model from previous example
var model = {
    name: "Michael",
    mainRegion: mainRegion
};
----

To make the Page Editor understand that an element is a region, it needs an attribute called data-portal-region with value being name of the region.

.Example view using regions
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
    <h2>Hello <span data-th-text="${name}">World</span></h2>
    <div data-portal-region="main">
      <div data-th-each="component : ${mainRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
        <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
----

We can now use the Page Editor drag and drop interface to drag components into our page.

[#layout]
== Layout

Layouts are used in conjunction with regions to organize the structure of the various component parts that will be placed on the page via Page Editor drag and drop. Layouts can be dropped into the page regions and then parts can be dragged into the layout. This allows multiple layouts (two-column, three-column, etc.) on the same page and web editors can change things around without touching any code. Making a layout is similar to making pages and part components. Layouts cannot be nested.

Layout contains - like pages and parts - a descriptor, a controller and a view, and should be placed in the folder site/layouts/[layout-name]


=== Descriptor

The layout descriptor defines regions within the layout where parts can be placed with the Page Editor. The file must be named [layout-name].xml.

.Example layout descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<layout>
  <display-name>70/30</display-name>
  <form />
  <regions>
    <region name="left"/>
    <region name="right"/>
  </regions>
</layout>
----

TIP: image:xp-760.svg[XP 7.6.0,opts=inline] It's possible to configure a layout to be used only on specific content types by using the config `<allow-on-content-type>`:

.Example layout descriptor allowed for one content type
[source,XML]
----
<layout>
  <display-name>70/30</display-name>
  <regions>
    <region name="left"/>
    <region name="right"/>
  </regions>
  <config>
    <allow-on-content-type>${app}:article</allow-on-content-type>
  </config>
</layout>
----

In this case the layout will be available only for the content type called "article" from the same application.

=== Controller

Controller is a Javascript file responsible for rendering of the layout view.

.Example layout controller
[source,js]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function (req) {
    var component = portal.getComponent();

    return {
        body: thymeleaf.render(resolve('./layout-70-30.html'), {
            leftRegion: component.regions["left"],
            rightRegion: component.regions["right"],
        })
    };

};
----

=== View

A layout view defines the markup for the layout component. The sample view below is created in Thymeleaf, but it could be created in any view engine that is supported.

.Example layout defined in Thymeleaf
[source,HTML]
----
<div class="row">
  <div data-portal-region="left" class="col-sm-8">
    <div data-th-each="component : ${leftRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div data-portal-region="right" class="col-sm-4" >
    <div data-th-each="component : ${rightRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

IMPORTANT: The HTML generated for the layout view must have a single root element.

=== Styling

For a layout to have any meaning, some styling must be applied to the view. The desired CSS should be placed in the /assets folder of the application, and included in the page where the layout should be supported. For example, the view my-first-page.html supports Bootstrap layouts:

.Example page descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <link data-th-href="${portal.assetUrl({'_path=css/bootstrap.min.css'})}" href="../assets/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
</head>
----

[#part]
== Part

Part components can be placed into any region of a page using the page editor https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/master/editor/context-panel[Context Panel].
This allows content editors to build and customize pages without writing any code. There are no built-in part components.
Each one is custom made in the application code. Parts are typically created to render custom content, lists of content, forms, etc.

IMPORTANT: Just as with a layout, a part needs an XML descriptor, an HTML view and a Javascript controller. Part config can be placed inside
the `<form>` of the part descriptor.

To add a part component to a page, edit the page content, open the “Insert” tab of the "Components" widget and drag the part component
placeholder (puzzle piece) to the desired location on the page. The part placeholder will now appear as a blue box with a dropdown selector.
The same part dropdown selector will appear in the "Inspect" tab. Use one of the selectors to find the desired part component.
Once a part component is selected, the placeholder will be replaced with the actual part, and the "Inspect" tab will show the part’s form, if available.

Parts can be added to multiple pages, or even multiple times within the same page. Each instance can have different form values.

TIP: image:xp-760.svg[XP 7.6.0,opts=inline] Just like layouts, parts can be configured to be available only for specific content types by using the config `<allow-on-content-type>`.

=== Custom icon
image:xp-720.svg[XP 7.2.0,opts=inline]

It's possible to define a custom icon for part which then will be used instead of the default one in the Page Component tree and dropdowns with part descriptors. 
Simply place an icon (in either PNG or SVG format) with the same name as the descriptor schema into the same folder. 
For example, if folder/part is called _mypart_ then part descriptor is called _mypart.xml_ and the icon file should be called either _mypart.svg_ or _mypart.png_.
In the screenshots below parts "_HTML Area Example_" and "_Image filters test_" are using custom icons.

== Text

The Text component allows content editors to place and format text into any region on a page without writing any code.
Images can also be added inside text components.
Macros allow Twitter tweets, YouTube videos, embedded code, and no-format text to be added as well.
The formatting and macro options are the same as those for the HtmlArea inputs that can be found in content types and other configuration forms in the Content Studio.
The only difference is that the formatting toolbar is at the top of the page for text components.

In the <<https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/master/editor/page-editor#,Page Editor>>, drag a Text component from the insert tab to the desired region on the page.
A cursor will appear inside the text component and editing can begin.
If another component is selected, the text component will need to be double-clicked to resume editing.

Here is an example.  The blue box is a text component being edited.  Although the pointer does not show in this screenshot,
it is hovering above the Underline box in the formatting toolbar, in order to underline the highlighted text, "Blog site!" :

image::text-component.png[Component list, 1305px]

== Image

IMPORTANT: This page component is *deprecated* and will be removed in XP 8.0. Use "Insert Image" feature of the Text Component instead.

The Image component allows content editors to place an image into any region on a page without writing any code.

In the Page Editor, drag an Image component placeholder from the insert tab to the desired region on the page.
Once placed, the empty image placeholder contains an image selector that can be used to find and select any previously
uploaded image content.
If the name of the image is known, start typing it in the box to filter the list of images.
If the name is not known, use the down arrow to open a list of image thumbnails to choose from.
Note that the list will contain all image content items in the XP installation, including images that were created in a
different site of a multi-site environment.

If the desired image does not already exist as a content, upload it with the button on the right side of the image selector dropdown.
The new image content will be created as a child of the page being edited, but it could be moved later if needed.

The inspect tab will also show the dropdown image selector.  If the image needs to be changed at a later time, this is the place to do it.

image::image-component.png[Component list, 1305px]

== Fragment

Fragments are essentially components stored as individual content.
When a fragment is altered, the change is instantly visible on every page that uses it.
This also adds a range of new possibilities when creating pages, such as time based publishing and permission control. 


=== Creating fragments

Fragments can be created from any component on a page.
When a fragment is created, it makes a content copy of the part, layout, image or text component.
In the page editor, right-click the desired component and select “Create fragment” from the context menu.
The new fragment content is created as a child of the page being edited.
The fragment content will open in a new editor tab where its name and configuration can be changed.
At the same time, the component that was copied is replaced with the new fragment.

=== Using fragments

Once a fragment content has been created, it can be added to pages with the page editor.
Drag a fragment placeholder from the “Insert” tab of the Context Panel to the desired location on the page.
Use the dropdown selector in the placeholder to find the desired fragment content.
Once selected, the fragment will appear.
