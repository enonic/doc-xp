= Components
:toc: right
:imagesdir: ../images

Any content item may be configured with a presentation - in the form of a page. Pages are editorially composed from one or more components.

== Regions
Regions are not strictly components themselves, but enable placement of components, kind of like a folder.
Regions have a fixed name, that is known to the component the region belongs to.

In Content Studio, regions are visually displayed as "dropzones" for components.

To exist, regions must actually be defined within another component. This definition is placed within the application code.
Only page and layout components support regions.

[#pages]
== Page

The page component is always the root entry of any component structure.
A page component may define zero, one, or multiple regions. Each region must have a unique name.

Conventionally, pages define a single region called "main".

To create a page component you must create the following files and folders in your project structure:

.page component project structure
[source,js]
----
/src/
  main/
    resources/
      site/
        pages/
          <page-name>/
            <page-name>.js
            <page-name>.xml
----

Replace <component-name> with your preferred name.

NOTE: The name you choose for a component will be used in the underlying data of the stored page. So choose your name wisely.

=== Page descriptor

The xml file placed in the component structure serves several purposes.

.Example page descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<page>
  <display-name i18n="component.page.name">My first page</display-name> <!--1--> <!--2-->
  <description>Front page of our site</description> <!--3-->
  <form/> <!--4-->
  <regions>
    <region name="main"/> <!--5-->
  </regions>
</page>
----

<1> *display-name* provides a display name used by the editorial interface
<2> *display-name/i18n* optionally specify localization key
<3> *description* Description field shown when creating a part in content studio
<4> *form* allows the definition of a configuration form based on the <<schemas#,schema system>>
<5> *region* optionally specify regions for the page

=== Page controller

A page controller handles requests to the page. The controller is a required file written in JavaScript and must be
named ``[page-name].js``. A controller exports a method for each type of HTTP request that should be handled.
The handle method has the request object as a parameter and returns the response object.

.Example page controller
[source,javascript]
----
// Handles a GET request
exports.get = function(req) {}

// Handles a POST request
exports.post = function(req) {}
----

Here's a simple controller that acts on the ``GET`` request method.

.Example simple get request
[source, javascript]
----
exports.get = function(req) {

  return {
    body: '<html><head></head><body><h1>My first page</h1></body></html>',
    contentType: 'text/html'
  };

};
----

*Render-view*

If you feel like concatenating strings to create an entire web page is a
little too much hassle, Enonic XP also supports views. A view is rendered
using a rendering engine; we currently support XSLT, Mustache and Thymeleaf
rendering engines. This example will use Thymeleaf.

To make a view, create a file ``my-first-page.html`` in the ``view`` folder.

.Example view file
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
----

In our ``[page-name].js`` file, we will need to parse the view to a string for
output. Here is where the Thymeleaf engine comes in. Using the Thymeleaf
rendering engine is easy; here is how we do it.

.Example controller with thymeleaf
[source, javascript]
----
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function(req) {

  // Resolve the view
  var view = resolve('/site/view/my-first-page.html');

  // Define the model
  var model = {
    name: "John Doe"
  };

  // Render a thymeleaf template
  var body = thymeleaf.render(view, model);

  // Return the result
  return {
    body: body,
    contentType: 'text/html'
  };

};
----

Unlike controllers and descriptors, view files can reside anywhere in your project
and have any valid file name. This allows for code reuse as
multiple page components can share the same view. If the view file is in the same
folder as the page controller then it can be resolved with only the file name
``resolve('file-name.html')``. Otherwise, the full path should be used, starting
with a '/' as in the example above.


*Dynamic-content*

We can send dynamic content to the view from the controller via the ``model``
parameter of the ``render`` function. We then need to use the rendering engine
specific syntax to render it. The controller file above passed a variable
called ``name`` and here is how to extract its value in the view using
Thymeleaf syntax.

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
    <h2>Hello <span data-th-text="${name}">World</span></h2>
  </body>
</html>
----

More on how to use Thymeleaf can be found in https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html[the official Thymeleaf documentation]

*Regions*

To be able to add components like images, component parts, or text to a page via Content Studio's page editor, we first need to create at least one region. Regions can be declared in the page descriptor. Each region will be referenced by name.

.Example regions in a [page].xml
[source, xml]
----
<page>
  <display-name>My first page</display-name>
  <form />
  <regions>
    <region name="main"/>
  </regions>
</page>
----

You will also need to handle regions in the controller.

.Example page controller using regions
[source, javascript]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');

// Get the current content. It holds the context of the current execution
// session, including information about regions in the page.
var content = portal.getContent();

// Include info about the region of the current content in the parameters
// list for the rendering.
var mainRegion = content.page.regions["main"];

// Extend the model from previous example
var model = {
    name: "Michael",
    mainRegion: mainRegion
};
----

To make the Page Editor understand that an element is a region, it needs an attribute called data-portal-region with value being name of the region.

.Example view using regions
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My first page, with a view!</h1>
    <h2>Hello <span data-th-text="${name}">World</span></h2>
    <div data-portal-region="main">
      <div data-th-each="component : ${mainRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
        <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
----

We can now use the Page Editor drag and drop interface to drag components into our page.

[#layout]
== Layout

Layouts - like page components a made up from a descriptor and a controller. 


=== Descriptor

Like pages, layouts needs a descriptor. The file must be placed within the component structure as follows /resources/site/layout/[layout-name]/[layout-name].xml.

Similar to the page descriptor, the layout descriptor defines regions, where other components may be placed.

.Example layout descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<layout>
  <display-name>70/30</display-name>
  <form />
  <regions>
    <region name="left"/>
    <region name="right"/>
  </regions>
</layout>
----

TIP: In addition to the standard configuration options, Content Studio supports https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/stable/editor/component-types#layout_component[custom filter definitions] that limit which content items a layout may be placed on.

=== Controller

The JavaScript file responsible for rendering the layout.

Like pages, the layout controller must be placed within the component structure as follows /resources/site/layouts/[layout-name]/[layout-name].js.


.Example layout controller
[source,js]
----
var portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
var thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

exports.get = function (req) {
    var component = portal.getComponent();

    return {
        body: thymeleaf.render(resolve('./layout-70-30.html'), {
            leftRegion: component.regions["left"],
            rightRegion: component.regions["right"],
        })
    };

};
----

=== View

Views are optional, but enable clean production of server-side markup for the component. The sample view below is created in Thymeleaf, but it could be created in any view engine that is supported.

.Example layout defined in Thymeleaf
[source,HTML]
----
<div class="row">
  <div data-portal-region="left" class="col-sm-8">
    <div data-th-each="component : ${leftRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div data-portal-region="right" class="col-sm-4" >
    <div data-th-each="component : ${rightRegion.components}" data-th-remove="tag">
      <div data-portal-component="${component.path}" data-th-remove="tag" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

IMPORTANT: Markup generated for a layout must have a single root element.

[#part]
== Part

Part components are similar to layouts, but do not support regions - making them leaf-nodes in a component structure.

=== Descriptor

Like pages and layouts, parts needs a descriptor. The descriptor file must be placed within the component structure as follows /resources/site/parts/[part-name]/[part-name].xml.

.Example part descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<part>
  <display-name>Content List</display-name>
  <form />
</layout>
----

TIP: In addition to the standard configuration options, Content Studio supports https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/stable/editor/component-types#part_component[custom filter definitions] that limit which content items the part may be placed on.

=== Controller

Just like pages and layouts, parts will need a controller in order to render properly. 

The controller file must be placed within the component structure as follows /resources/site/parts/[part-name]/[part-name].js.

IMPORTANT: Markup generated for a part must have a single root element.



=== Custom icon
image:xp-720.svg[XP 7.2.0,opts=inline]

It's possible to define a custom icon for part which then will be used instead of the default one in the Page Component tree and dropdowns with part descriptors. 
Simply place an icon (in either PNG or SVG format) with the same name as the descriptor schema into the same folder. 
For example, if folder/part is called _mypart_ then part descriptor is called _mypart.xml_ and the icon file should be called either _mypart.svg_ or _mypart.png_.
In the screenshots below parts "_HTML Area Example_" and "_Image filters test_" are using custom icons.


:imagesdir: images

image::part-component-2.png[Page Components tree, 211]

== Text

The Text component allows content editors to place and format text into any region of a page.

Text components also support rich content such as Images and Macros

The formatting and macro options are the same as those for the HtmlArea inputs that can be found in content types and other configuration forms in the Content Studio.

Here is an example.  The blue box is a text component being edited:

image::text-component.png[Component list, 1305px]

== Fragment

Fragments are essentially components stored as individual content.
When a fragment is altered, the change is instantly visible on every page that uses it.
This also adds a range of new possibilities when creating pages, such as time based publishing and permission control. 


=== Creating fragments

Fragments are essentially component instances that can be re-used across pages. A fragment can be created from any component on a given page. 

A fragment is saved as a separate content instance, which means it can be managed and published like any other content item.

image::fragment-component.png[Component list, 578px]

== Image

IMPORTANT: Image comonent is *deprecated* and will be removed in XP 8.0. Use "Insert Image" feature of the Text Component instead.

The Image component allows content editors to place an image into any region on a page without writing any code.
