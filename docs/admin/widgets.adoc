== Introduction

Widgets are user interface components that dynamically extends Admin interfaces.

NOTE: Currently, the only admin tool that implements widget support is https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio[Content Studio's]. Specifically, through the context panel.


== Implementation

Widgets are essentially a specialized web apps. Like all other XP components, they are defined by a controller and a descriptor.

To create a widget, add a new folder in your project structure, i.e.  `src/main/resources/admin/widgets/<widget-name>`.
The folder must contain both a descriptor (`<widget-name>.xml`), and a controller (`<widget-name>.js`).

=== Descriptor

The widget descriptor defines the display name, which roles are required to access the widget and the interfaces it implements.

An interface is simply a unique identifier that links the widget to its extension point (i.e. Content Studio's context panel)

For example, for your widget to be displayed in the "Content Studio" detail panel, specify the interface `contentstudio.contextpanel`.

The descriptor file must match the widget folder name, i.e. `admin/widgets/<widget-name>/<widget-name>.xml`.

.Sample descriptor file:
[source,xml]
----
<widget>
  <display-name>My first widget</display-name>
  <description>Description of my first widget</description>
  <interfaces>
    <interface>contentstudio.contextpanel</interface>
  </interfaces>
  <allow>
    <principal>role:system.admin</principal>
    <principal>role:myapp.myrole</principal>
  </allow>
</widget>
----

=== Controller

To drive the widget, we will need a <<../framework/controllers#, controller>>. The controller typically renders the  widget's initial html.
Depending on the widget implementation it may also handle any further server requests from the widgets interface.

The controller file must match the widget name, i.e. `admin/widgets/<widget-name>/<widget-name>.js`:

.Example controller file:
[source, js]
----
exports.get = function (req) {
    return {
        body: '<widget>My first widget</widget>',
        contentType: 'text/html'
    };
};
----

NOTE: Depending on the interface the widget is implementing, the controller may be initialised with parameters, for instance providing a specific context.

=== Icon

Widgets may also have icons. Simply place an SVG or PNG file into the widget folder, i.e. `admin/widgets/<widget-name>/<widget-name>.svg``

== Context Panel widgets

INFO: This section contains specific details on implementing Context panels for Content studio.

Once your widget application is deployed, the widget should become available in the Content Studio's Context Panel.

The ID of currently selected content item and the contextual repository/branch will be passed to the widget via request parameter: `contentId`

Since context panel widgets are context-dependent (requires contentId), remember to add a proper check/error feedback to the controller:

[source, js]
----
exports.get = function (req) {
    var contentId = req.params.contentId;
    if (!contentId) {

        return {
            contentType: 'text/html',
            body: '<widget class="error">No content selected</widget>'
        };
    }
}
----
